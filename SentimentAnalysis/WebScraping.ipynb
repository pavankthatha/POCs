      "b\"Tivo made us wait quite a long time to get a voice-controlled remote, but they have really nailed it. I paired this with my existing Tivo Bolt -- took just a minute and was easy to do, although I did have to use the advanced pairing since it didn't automatically connect. I was surprised that the bluetooth connection actually works better than my old RF Tivo remote -- much faster and more responsive when you hit a button. Wow. Even better, I have my TiVo in a closed closet and the Bluetooth seems to connect more reliably RF.\"\n",
      "b'Then there is the voice control. First, make sure you have the new TiVo update, which you can request directly at Tivo.com (although I\\'m sure it will be automatically downloaded to all customers soon). It understands my voice extremely well, even with noise in the room. You can ask for things like a tv station \"NBC\" and it will take you directly there. Ask it for a game like \"Michigan Football\" and presto, you get the next upcoming game with the option to record. Or ask it for a show you have recorded, and it also pops up to start watching. For the most part, it understands everything you ask it, but when I asked for \"60 Minutes\" it couldn\\'t help. Not sure why, but I\\'m sure they\\'ll keep refining it.'\n",
      "b\"Finally, I like the new Tivo interface, but it has a few quirks. First, they took away my favorite version of the TiVo guide -- not sure why. I guess now with the voice remote, it won't matter much. It also seems to show recorded episodes with the oldest showing first -- I prefer the opposite. Overall, it's gotten a little overwhelming and confusing, but perhaps will get better once I use it more.\"\n",

      "b\"Tivo made us wait quite a long time to get a voice-controlled remote, but they have really nailed it. I paired this with my existing Tivo Bolt -- took just a minute and was easy to do, although I did have to use the advanced pairing since it didn't automatically connect. I was surprised that the bluetooth connection actually works better than my old RF Tivo remote -- much faster and more responsive when you hit a button. Wow. Even better, I have my TiVo in a closed closet and the Bluetooth seems to connect more reliably RF.\"\n",
      "b'Then there is the voice control. First, make sure you have the new TiVo update, which you can request directly at Tivo.com (although I\\'m sure it will be automatically downloaded to all customers soon). It understands my voice extremely well, even with noise in the room. You can ask for things like a tv station \"NBC\" and it will take you directly there. Ask it for a game like \"Michigan Football\" and presto, you get the next upcoming game with the option to record. Or ask it for a show you have recorded, and it also pops up to start watching. For the most part, it understands everything you ask it, but when I asked for \"60 Minutes\" it couldn\\'t help. Not sure why, but I\\'m sure they\\'ll keep refining it.'\n",
      "b\"Finally, I like the new Tivo interface, but it has a few quirks. First, they took away my favorite version of the TiVo guide -- not sure why. I guess now with the voice remote, it won't matter much. It also seems to show recorded episodes with the oldest showing first -- I prefer the opposite. Overall, it's gotten a little overwhelming and confusing, but perhaps will get better once I use it more.\"\n",

      "b\"WoW, Amazing, this remote was totaly worth the whole software upgrade (Tivo Experience) Not only can you say what show you want to watch but it will also bring up the channel. All you have to say is the Channel # or say what channel, HGTV or ESPN, etc. Pairing was easy and fast. If your that one person that has to write a negative review on setup, that means YOU did it wrong. I have had no issues with picture quality. Remember you must upgrade to the new Software first (which takes up to 3 days to do from the time of request), eventually it with come automatically, but for now you must request this with Tivo, It will not automatically happen. By the way none of the buttons are lighted, just like the old remotes, so don't be surprised. Don't worry you do not have to purchase new Tivo Boxes in order to use the new features, just upgrade the software and remote. The rewind and fast forward are also much faster now.\"\n",

      "b'This works really well! I\\'m not overly fond of the button layout, but it\\'s basically the same as other TiVo remotes. For this to work on my TiVo Bolt, I had to have TiVo support upgrade my Bolt unit with the \"New Experience\" guide software. It took them a little more than 24 hours to do that, but once it was updated the remote worked as advertised. Great voice searching capabilities. The upgraded guide is free, but I believe if you have a unit that\\'s older (different model) than the Bolt, then you will need some kind of accessory unit to make those older TiVos compatible with the Vox Remote.'\n",

My old slide pro remote was a learning remote and I was able to program it to turn ON/OFF BOTH the TV and the AV receiver. I CAN\\'T DO THATt with the VOX remote.  It won\\'t TURN OFF/ON two devices at the same time. Also, to skip  the Ads (which is a GREAT feature), on the old slide remote pro,  I push on the D button and it skips. You can do that on a VOX remote, but to use your voice, you have to push Voice and then speak \"Skip\", so two steps on the new VOX remote- push button and speak, while one step on the old slide remote- push D.'\n",
