\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI have a Premiere 4 with the 20.3.1 update (I will have to double check, but I believe so because I see MLB.TV is an app option now). For the past week I have had trouble Netflix. Up until that point, absolutely no problems with the app.
\r\nI will start streaming a movie or TV episode and the pause/play/up buttons do not do anything. The content will play fine, but when it is over I just get a black screen and I have to press the Tivo button to get back to the Tivo Menu. If I go back into Netflix, it loads and I can play content but the same issues happen. I have to reset the Tivo in order for Netflix to work properly again.
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYup I\'m seeing this exact issue on both my Premiere 4 and Premiere on 20.3.1. It usually happens halfway through a show either a half hour or one hour or longer. Also noticed that the subtitles freeze up during this time as well which can get annoying. I always end up having to "bail out" by using either the TiVo button, Live TV button, or Clear button, then go back into the app and pick up where I left off.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf it doesn't lock up, I also have the problem of not being able to select other episodes."
\r\nIf I push the Tivo button and return home, I can go back into NetFlix and watch the next episode, but the load times make this a poor work around.\n\t\t\t\t\t

Hi all- The issues reported earlier have been fixed. Our apologies - and thank you for your patience.

Yes, issue started after the rollout and has continued after the Tivo/Netflix this past weekend. Last night I had something on pause and Netflix stopped responding. Play, Pause, Up button..none of those did anything. I had to use the Tivo button to escape.
\nEDIT: I just talked to Tivo Support in a chat and the agent said this, "Matthew: That is a strange issue that has been an issue with some customers after the download. 
\n Matthew: We are currently researching the issue in hopes of releasing a patch update to resolve any new bug issues. 
\n Matthew: What you may want to try is unchecking Netflix in the Video Provider Listing in Channel Settings. Force a manual connection, and then recheck and try streaming from Netflix once more."
\nI will try that later on. At least they know about the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t

\r\nI had the exact same condition/problem yesterday.
\r\nDaughter left netflix paused for hours.. (luckily she shut off the TV) when we came back netflix came out of pause with the play, but then nothing worked.... except Tivo button... ( long wait for the app to shut down ).
\r\nThe "fix" that they suggested is the standard song and dance for app/video provider problems.  The next fix will be to unplug the tivo and wait for 30 seconds....\n\t\t\t\t\t

I have the Netflix channel 204 on my TiVo box, I go to the channel, press red and nothing happens.
I have had the box for about a year now and it has never worked.
oes anyone know why this could be or have you have the same issue and have a resolution for it.
I really like the idea of being able to watch Netflix but is a disappointment everytime I load the channel and...nothing.

he Netflix channel literally does nothing. Just stays on the black screen with Netflix in the middle, saying press red.
When I press red on the remote nothing happens. The screen does not change. And I know my remote is not broken as I use that all the time and the red button works fine on the tv guide.

It works fine on the tv downstairs. Just not upstairs. Strange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t

iVo Roamio OTA review: It feels like going back in time

"Channel Master DVR+ review: Over-the-air recording that's a bit too basic"
iVo Bolt Vox DVR review: New look, same old app problem
iVo Roamio OTA review: This DVR would be a cord-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s dream machine, if...
If you want to ditch cable without losing the cable DVR experience\xe2\x80\x94warts and all\xe2\x80\x94the TiVo Roamio OTA is your answer.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s $400 DVR for over-the-air channels has all the creature comforts of a cable box, from the traditional channel grid and button-packed remote control to the seemingly limitless recording options for TV shows and movies. And like TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s own cable boxes, it comes with some powerful ad-skipping features.
But TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old-school approach to recording broadcasts from an antenna also brings some baggage. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get lost in the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s labyrinthine menus, or forget what button you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to press. And while TiVo tries to be a complete cord-cutting solution with both over-the-air and streaming video, its options for the latter can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with dedicated streaming boxes like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Nvidia Shield TV.
he TiVo Roamio OTA is a hulking piece of creaky plastic, more like a cable box than a modern streaming device. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s an HDMI output, an optical audio jack for connecting to older sound systems, and, quizzically, a couple USB ports whose only purpose is to charge other devices (external USB storage is not supported). You supply your own antenna, which plugs into the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial input.
"If you want to expand the Roamio OTA's storage, you'll need to replace its existing internal drive. The USB ports are only good for charging devices and the only compatible e-SATA drive was discontinued."
Inside, the box has 1TB of storage\xe2\x80\x94good for about 150 hours of HD programming\xe2\x80\x94and four tuners, so you can watch or record four programs at once. The internal drive is replaceable, but while the Roamio OTA technically allows external storage via a rear e-SATA port, the only supported drive is WD\xe2\x80\x99s DVR Extender, which is no longer manufactured or sold.
qually cable-like is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s remote control, a hefty implement with more than 40 buttons for changing channels, controlling the TV, controlling playback, and navigating through the TiVo Guide. Having almost every conceivable function just a button press away makes some sense, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to create whiplash for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s used to streaming remotes, with their minimalist designs, contextual on-screen menus, and voice search.
he remote does, however, have some welcome departures from cable boxes: It uses an RF signal to control the TiVo\xe2\x80\x94no line-of-sight required\xe2\x80\x94but still includes an IR blaster for your television\xe2\x80\x99s volume, power, and input. Best of all, it lets you easily skip advertisements. Pressing up or the green \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button during commercials automatically takes you to the end of the break on certain programs, and there\xe2\x80\x99s also a dedicated button for jumping ahead by 30 seconds.
"TiVo's remote is loaded with buttons. On the bright side, it has both RF and infrared transmitters."
iVo used to charge for DVR service, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the $400 price. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to pay up front, but in the long run it beats paying TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old $15-per-month service charge.
In terms of raw capabilities, the TiVo Roamio OTA offers an impressive amount of granular controls. When setting up a series recording\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cOnePass\xe2\x80\x9d in TiVo lingo\xe2\x80\x94you can record just new airings, limit recordings to a specific channel, record in HD only, record in SD only, keep only recent recordings, keep recordings only until you run out space, and add buffer time on either end of the recording. Through TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWishList\xe2\x80\x9d section, you can even program recordings for a specific actor, director, category, or keyword.
iVo also pulls TV episodes from various streaming services into OnePass, so if a show is on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu, it\xe2\x80\x99ll show up in the same list as your over-the-air recordings. The feature will likely be most beneficial to Hulu subscribers, given that service\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on network television. With Netflix and Amazon, you may find that there\xe2\x80\x99s not much overlap between recorded and streaming series.
"TiVo's channel guide offers impressively granular control over what you want to watch now and record for later."
Use TiVo enough, and the system will even start automatically recording programs that it thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ll like. You\xe2\x80\x99re still in charge of fine-tuning the suggestion algorithms by giving thumbs up or down to whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re watching, but being able to populate the DVR without programming everything manually is a nice way to feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth.
Where TiVo falters is in helping users make sense of its many features. The TiVo Roamio OTA is overwrought with menus that are redundant or of dubious utility, including two separate menus for launching apps, two areas for browsing live TV, and a recommendations row on the main menu that rarely seems relevant. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a menu full of curated movie and TV show \xe2\x80\x9ccollections,\xe2\x80\x9d but TiVo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t label the sources for this content up front, and in many cases the selections are only for rental or purchase.
he whole interface could use a complete overhaul. One is supposedly 
, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see how that redesign works on a day-to-day basis.
iVo\'s curated "collections" don\'t indicate where the content is coming from, so you won\'t know if it\'s included in a service you already have or if you\'ll need to pay more to access it.
hose issues aside, the TiVo Roamio OTA is also missing some benefits you\xe2\x80\x99d get with other over-the-air DVR solutions.
Its app selection, for instance, is dismal compared to dedicated streaming boxes. New streaming bundles such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now are absent, and the only TV Everywhere apps are HBO Go and Epix. New streaming services like SeeSo, Pluto.TV, and Filmstruck aren\xe2\x80\x99t available either. The apps that do exist also seem slower than their streaming box counterparts, especially those that come from the Opera TV app store. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect TiVo to serve all your streaming needs unless they\xe2\x80\x99re fairly basic.
nd unlike OTA DVR products from Tablo, HDHomeRun, and Plex, TiVo can\xe2\x80\x99t stream your recordings onto other connected devices, at least not without additional hardware. Watching TV on your phone or tablet requires a $130 TiVo Stream box, and watching on other televisions requires a 
, raising the cost considerably if you want a whole-home or out-of-home solution.
he TiVo Roamio OTA is still worthwhile for folks who want a powerful DVR solution, but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the vagaries of streaming. With four tuners, ample recording options, and helpful ad-skipping features, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s over-the-air DVR excels at squeezing every bit of value out of your antenna signal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to shake the feeling that its best days are behind it.

 smaller, faster media box to meet your TV watching needs -- at home or away
iVo Bolt DVR streams 4K and streamlines the way you watch TV
"Whether you're a cable cutter or you just want to ditch your cable provider's DVR, TiVo's latest box has something for you. Its handy new features make watching your favorite shows -- whatever the source -- more enjoyable."
he TiVo Bolt combines a best-in-class DVR experience with a streaming media box; it has the capability to stream and download recorded content to iOS and Android devices; and easy expansion to other rooms with TiVo Mini extenders; skip commercials on primetime TV recordings with a single button press; excellent cross-service search.
he still-required monthly or "lifetime" service fees raise the total cost of ownership; though the app selection is very good, you still may need another streaming-media box to fill in the gaps; doesn\'t work with satellite or AT&T U-verse.
he TiVo Bolt makes a strong claim to the throne as king of DVRs and streaming media, but those pesky TiVo service fees keep it short of perfection.
"TiVo's supply of on-demand apps continues to grow, but at the moment this includes Netflix, Amazon Instant Video with Prime, Hulu Plus (coming soon to Bolt), YouTube, Yahoo, Aol On, Vudu, Plex, Web Video Hotlist and HSN for video. Spotify, iHeartRadio and Pandora are available for music. Also, the app platform is based on the Opera web browser, and the Bolt has access to apps developed for that browser. "

\n      TiVo Bolt review: Watching TV faster\n    
kip commercials with one click, and speed up the rest of the show, too
Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo has no commercial-skipping button\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\'t make good business sense."
It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.
nd the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. \xe2\x80\x9cSkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant,\xe2\x80\x9d TiVo now boasts.
, a new weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and  Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.
Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.
In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.
nd that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.
he latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock".
till, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.
he Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.
Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 Gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.
But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit Ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)
Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.
iVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.
o make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."
"One of the most important features of the Bolt isn't new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku."
For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.
ow, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".
ot only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.
In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.
nd, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.
In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.
Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.
lso, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.
While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.
I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.
But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.
ure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.

lthough TiVo remains the best TV-watching experience out there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room for improvement. Parts of the experience are stuck in a time warp and feel like no one has touched them since the days when TiVo relied on dial-up. TiVo is oh-so-close to perfect that I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see them cross that finish line.

"The Bolt is TiVo's smallest, sleekest DVR yet. And it packs some powerful new features like 4K video support, the ability to speed up your shows, and a button to skip past entire commercial blocks with one quick press. "
iVo has been facing some stiff competition in the form of cable and satellite company-provided 
"\xc2\xa0and streaming video services like Hulu, making\xc2\xa0its subscription plan and expensive hardware look less and less appealing. The Bolt could be the DVR that puts TiVo back on top. At $299.99 for a 500GB model and $399.99 for a 1TB version, it's still a relatively pricey device, but it's more affordable than the previous generation of TiVos, and comes with a year of service included, so you don't need to commit to a monthly fee in the first year. Add four tuners, robust content management, out-of-the-home streaming of recordings and live television, and an easy-to-use (albeit text-heavy) interface, and you have a very compelling\xc2\xa0DVR that works with both cable and over-the-air (OTA) television. It's our new Editors' Choice for digital video recorders."
"\xc2\xa0is almost Apple-like in design: simple, white, and curved. It looks like a slightly warped box that lifts off of the ground half an inch in a gentle slope on the left side. The front bears a black TiVo logo at the top of the curve, and a small green power LED on the right side of the panel. The back holds an HDMI port, a coaxial cable/antenna connector, an Ethernet port, two USB ports, an eSATA connector for adding storage, 3.5mm and optical audio outputs, the power connector, and a Remote Finder button that makes the remote beep audibly. The CableCARD slot hides behind the Bolt's casing, on the underside of the device. "
he remote is a large, curved dog bone of a wand, with a white top panel and black underside. It has two large circular pads: one with directions around a Select button for menu navigation, and one with playback controls around a Pause button. They feel very similar under the thumb, which can make navigating menus in the dark a bit awkward. The remote also has a number pad, four color buttons, and a set of TV controls, including a separate TV Power button.
"As mentioned above, the Bolt comes with one free year of TiVo service. After that, it costs $149.99 per year or $14.99 per month. If you want to use the Bolt with your cable or FiOS service, you're going to need a CableCARD from your service provider. However, the Bolt can also work with OTA broadcasts, which is how we configured it in our test lab. Satellite service is not supported."
etting up the Bolt was simple, but tedious. Connecting everything and telling the device information like geographical location and Wi-Fi network was very straightforward and guided by on-screen prompts. However, getting the Bolt to the point where it could actually show television took over an hour of preparing, setting up, and downloading all of the data it needed to function.
Once everything was up running, the Bolt functioned smoothly. All available OTA channels appeared in the live program guide, and information about current and upcoming shows was aggregated across the various menus. Search results and apps were also responsive.
"TiVo has tweaked and polished its interface over the years, but it remains very text-heavy compared with most streaming media devices. The menu system is built around lists of easy-to-read text choices, with graphics like show logos appearing in the periphery or a few menu levels down from the main screen. It's very easy to navigate, and leaves little ambiguity in menu choices. Whatever screen you're on in the interface, the top right corner will show the current live television feed or recording, letting you keep an eye on what you are\xc2\xa0watching."
With everything set up, I started to populate the TiVo recording schedule. The classic Season Pass feature has been replaced by OnePass, which collects episodes of your favorite shows across both live television and online services. I added new episodes of\xc2\xa0
, and any and all episodes of 
"By default, the Bolt shows its own unique Live Guide when you press the Guide button rather than a conventional grid-based guide. However,\xc2\xa0the Live Guide\xc2\xa0is fairly functional, and you can switch the view to a grid guide in a settings menu. It displays a list of available channels and what is currently playing on each on the left side of the screen. The right side displays what will be on the currently selected channel in the near future. Browsing through channels instantly updates this list to show upcoming programming. It doesn't offer as much information on-screen at a given time as a grid display, but it's a bit simpler to navigate."
"Besides live television from cable, FiOS, or OTA, the Bolt can access streaming television and movies from a handful of sources. It supports Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, YouTube, Plex, Vudu, and AOL On, plus streaming music through Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio. Once you've signed in to your respective accounts for the different services on the Bolt, your search results and OnePass information expands to include those services. With "
"The TiVo Central menu displays a rotating selection of four shows or movies on the top of the screen, highlighting what's already in OnePass, upcoming live television, and new content available on demand. From the main screen you can look up your OnePass recordings and streaming content under My Shows; see what is currently on live television under What to Watch Now; search for content or browse lists, collections, and streaming video services under Find TV, Movies & Videos; and check your OnePass settings and both upcoming and previous recordings under Manage Recordings & OnePass."
he vast majority of what you want to watch can be found under the aforementioned headings, but two separate sections, Music & Photos and Apps & Games, offer additional options for content. Music & Photos currently only includes music apps and Plex. Apps & Games offers full access to the Opera TV Store and its app ecosystem, but using it was sluggish and apps were slow to load.
"The TiVo Bolt offers two handy features to make watching your favorite shows faster: QuickMode and SkipMode. SkipMode lets you automatically jump to the end of a commercial break by pressing the green button on the remote. However, it only works on certain shows, most of which are prime time network programming. You can't skip commercial breaks on the vast majority of content."
"QuickMode speeds up recordings by 30 percent and pitch-corrects the audio to make dialogue sound natural. This works with anything you record, and it's very effective. Be wary when watching actors who naturally speak quickly, though; it's easy to miss lines when already fast dialogue is sped up by nearly a third. Still, it's a great way to quickly catch up on a backlog of recordings without missing out on anything important."
"\xc2\xa0video output, though you won't find this to be very useful with your cable or OTA television yet. Currently, UHD video isn't broadcast in any way over the air or through cable services. However, you can watch 4K content on Netflix and Amazon Video through the Bolt. I loaded episodes of\xc2\xa0"

. You can remotely control the Bolt with the free TiVo remote app for Android and iOS. More importantly, you\xc2\xa0can stream your OnePass recordings and live television to mobile devices and Web browsers. The Bolt also supports multi-room television setups with optional 
\xc2\xa0expansion boxes. One\xc2\xa0weakness: relatively limited\xc2\xa0storage space when compared with the 3TB Roamio Pro.\xc2\xa0

". Of course, we haven't quite reached the point where\xc2\xa0"
\xc2\xa0is available to stream the day after it airs, so compromises have to be made depending on the shows you want to watch.
"The TiVo Bolt doesn't force you to compromise, and offers the best (and one of the most economical) TiVo experiences yet. It's still a bit pricey at $300 for 500GB of storage, but an eSATA drive can fix that, and the included year of TiVo service really softens the blow (though you'll have to pay for a TiVo subscription after that as long as you use the Bolt). It handles both cable and OTA, and incorporates several major streaming video services seamlessly into its interface. It's easy to use, and powerful enough to serve as your main media hub for both live television and streaming content, making it our Editors' Choice for DVRs."
"The Bolt is TiVo's smallest, sleekest DVR yet. And it packs some powerful new features like 4K video support, the ability to speed up your shows, and a button to skip past entire commercial blocks with one quick press. "

, and rumors are swirling that a 4K Roku\xc2\xa0is days away from announcement. It seems clear that 4K UHD support is the next big thing for streaming set-top boxes (unless, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99re Apple TV). Now you can add TiVo to that list of supporters with the introduction of the new TiVo Bolt Unified Entertainment System.
ressed in a Storm Trooper-White chassis that is both sleeker and more compact than TiVo DVRs of the past, the Bolt aims to redefine what people think of when they think TiVo.
kipMode is the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial).
ptly described by the company as a \xe2\x80\x9cUnified Entertainment System\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a DVR, the 4-tuner Bolt carries on the tradition 
he bottom line: With a boatload of fun new features, 4K UHD streaming apps, and the best content-searching system available, the TiVo Bolt is in prime position to take over as your home entertainment hub.
When it comes to set-top design, big black boxes are out and significantly smaller black boxes are in. Even cable companies stuck in the last century have managed to shrink down the size of their cable boxes. Anyway, TiVo needed a new look, and the Bolt supplies this in a bold way. The new chassis is bright white, the on-board buttons are gone, and the lights have been integrated. The box is also much smaller than TiVo units of the past \xe2\x80\x93 33 percent smaller than the Roamio and 65 percent smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro, according to TiVo. And then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s strange arch in the middle \xe2\x80\x93 this is likely more of a utility feature than an aesthetic choice, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that later.
urprisingly, TiVo still uses a mechanical hard drive here (likely to keep costs down). The new Bolt is available in a 500GB model for $300 and a 1,000GB (that\xe2\x80\x99s 1 TB to everyone else) goes for $400. One year of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service (normally $150 per year) is included with each. \t\t\t

In the box with the\xc2\xa0Bolt is a white 12-volt DC power cable, a white TiVo remote, and a black 6-foot HDMI cable, along with a setup and product features guide.
ot much is new in terms of connectivity for the TiVo Bolt. The most notable change is the inclusion of an HDMI 2.0a compliant output for the latest 4K UHD support. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also find two USB 2.0 ports and an eSATA port for external storage.
iVo needed a new look, and the Bolt supplies this in a bold way.
n Ethernet port provides a hard-lined connection to the Internet, which we recommend for 4K UHD content streaming, though a built-in Wi-Fi adapter is available (which won\xe2\x80\x99t work with the TiVo mini, by the way). For those with neither of the aforementioned network options, the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial cable connector does support MoCA for Internet over a cable connection \xe2\x80\x94 separate MoCA adapter required. Inside the Bolt is a 4-tuner DVR capable of recording \xe2\x80\xa6 you guessed it, four shows at a time.
iVo also placed the box\xe2\x80\x99s CableCARD slot underneath the unit, behind a small panel.
On the feature front, however, plenty is new. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the breakdown
kipMode \xe2\x80\x93 Perhaps the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial), SkipMode takes TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ad-avoidance capabilities to the next level. Rather than force users to press a skip button several times during commercial breaks, SkipMode removes them automatically at the press of a single button. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the catch, though: SkipMode works only with certain primetime and late night TV shows, and only after they have been completely recorded \xe2\x80\x93 it won\xe2\x80\x99t work if you start watching while the recording is in progress. Still, this new feature gives users an extremely powerful tool for cruising through their favorite programs, requiring minimal effort to avoid long-running ads along the way.
QuikMode \xe2\x80\x93 This feature allows the user to get through long-running programs a little bit faster. Similar to the speeding up of syndicated content that certain networks employ in order to cram in more ads, QuickMode speeds up the show by 30 percent (1.3 times the standard play rate) but without raising the pitch of the sound. For example, you could cruise through a 3-hour sports broadcast in just 2 hours and 6 minutes, but the game announcers won\xe2\x80\x99t sound like chipmunks \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99ll just sound like auctioneers.
4K UHD Apps \xe2\x80\x93 Though we\xe2\x80\x99re a little disappointed that 4K UHD app support is a bit scant at launch, the Bolt will support 4K UHD streams from Netflix and YouTube right away. Support for Amazon, Vudu, and other 4K UHD streaming content is expected (and needed) in the near future.
ven more apps \xe2\x80\x93 The Bolt also supports Plex, Pandora, Spotify, and Rdio, connecting you with content you have on your home network, as well as tunes from popular streaming music services.
upport for Apple TV and Fire TV \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo would probably prefer that you invest in one of its TiVo Mini boxes to share stored content with other televisions in the house, but with support for Apple Airplay and a new TiVo Android app available for Fire TV, you can use the streamers you might already have to access all of your recordings. The TiVo Mini is still the best tool for getting the most out of the Bolt, however, with support for SkipMode, QuickMode, and access to streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more.
emote finder \xe2\x80\x93 Press a button on the back of the Bolt and a little song will play from your remote, enabling you to find it among the couch cushions, in the fridge, or wherever else you are prone to misplacing it.
iVo offers the best search feature available on the market. Simply plug the title of what you want to watch into the OneSearch box, and TiVo will show you where you can watch it and how much, if anything, it will cost you. When you search for a movie or TV show, TiVo polls your DVR recordings, live TV, VOD (in select markets), and apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant, and Vudu (depending on whether you have a subscription) to show you where you can watch and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fee involved. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to avoid paying twice for a flick you already paid to have access to.
\xc2\xa0lets you watch live and stored content anywhere you have an Internet connection. And if you know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be away from the Internet for a long period of time, you can download your stored recordings for offline viewing any time you want. The app also works as a remote control and allows users to manage recordings.
Current TiVo owners will be happy to know the Bolt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t present any unpleasant surprises. The interface looks and feels exactly as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no learning curve. Aside from having to manage some settings in order to get your OnePass recordings going and secure access to your streaming service accounts (entering usernames and passwords), getting the Bolt up and running is a piece of cake.
hose new to TiVo will wonder how they ever put up with their cable company\xe2\x80\x99s terrible interface for so long. Unnecessarily long strings of menu options are a thing of the past with most common commands just a few clicks away. And for a really easy search experience, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app cuts a lot of time out of data entry.
For this review, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on evaluating the new features the Bolt brings to the table. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with QuickSkip which was everything we had hoped it would be. Remarkably, we were able to skip entire segments of The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon so that we could get to the parts we really wanted to see. The skip is nearly instantaneous, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not certain whether you\xe2\x80\x99re watching a show that is QuickSkip enabled, the Bolt will remind you. Our only complaint (and likely an unreasonable one) is that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use the feature on every show, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just us being greedy. The feature covers most of the primetime favorites, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be plenty for most.
QuickMode is a great idea, but we think it will take some getting used to for most folks. Returning to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, the comedian and host often speaks quickly enough that speeding him up makes some of what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying unintelligible. On top of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain comedy to the sped-up, quick-clipped movement you see when watching standard TV programming. However, we imagine this feature will be great for golf and other slow-paced sports, and an absolute God-send for any long lectures one might have to sit through. Now if only we could QuickMode life when we wanted to!
treaming 4K UHD media went exactly as expected. We think TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s superior services and search abilities make using the Bolt appealing as an alternative to using the 4K UHD apps embedded in Smart TVs. The Bolt also packs plenty of horsepower, quickly loading apps and keeping buffering to a minimum when Internet speeds were sufficient.
Our complaints are few. Chief among them, however, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no Amazon Prime Instant 4K UHD support right out of the box. You get Amazon Prime, sure, just no 4K UHD video, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a disappointment.
We\xe2\x80\x99re also sad that out-of-home streaming isn\xe2\x80\x99t available at launch, though TiVO promises it will be offered in a future firmware update.
he Bolt isn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to handle streaming High Dynamic Range (HDR) content yet, either. The company told Digital Trends that HDR is too much a moving target, with three different formats competing. That may be true, but Amazon has picked its pony, so we can only hope TiVo is prepared to react when Amazon brings this new element of 4K UHD video to consumers.
We should note that the Bolt runs a little warm. Conveniently, however, the box\xe2\x80\x99s exhaust fan is located underneath the chassis at the apex of the angle, maximizing exhaust and cooling potential. The only potential issue we see with the shape, however, is that it is destined to the top component on any stack, as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be placing anything on top of it.
Other issues are just nitpicks. For instance: The included Plex is quartered in the Music and Photos menu, even though it very much plays video.

While Amazon, Apple, Roku, and Google primarily have the attention of so-called cord-cutters and cord-nevers (those who have given up cable or never had it) the TiVo Bolt appeals to everyone \xe2\x80\x93 and especially cable subscribers \xe2\x80\x93 with a long list of useful features you simply won\xe2\x80\x99t find anywhere else. In a world where the digital content we want to watch is smeared across a jagged landscape, the TiVo Bolt does an outstanding job of putting everything you want to watch, and listen to, in one place. Without a doubt, the Bolt is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s most outstanding product to date.

"TiVo Roamio Pro review: TiVo's new DVRs are the company's best yet"

"It's been three and a half years since the last "
\n            Gallery: TiVo Roamio Pro review | 18 Photos\n          
Very fast performanceSix tunersNow comes with an RF remoteOut-of-home streaming now an option
"No HDMI-CECCan be pricey with lifetime serviceOut-of-home streaming isn't always smoothUpgrading from an old TiVo is still tedious"
"The new TiVo Roamio addresses almost every major complaint we had previously. In short, it's most definitely the TiVo you've been waiting for."
op: Roamio Pro; bottom: a TiVo Premiere box.
he connections and form factor of the TiVo Roamio Pro are very similar to that of the 
": a CableCARD slot, one coax connector, two USB ports, Ethernet, eSATA, Toslink, analog audio / video and HDMI out. What's new are the internals, including 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi and a new chip (a Broadcom BCM7241) that has the power to speed up the TiVo user experience, as well as launch third-party apps quickly and stream content to other devices. All at the same time. There are also more tuners and bigger hard drives. At the high end, we have the Pro for $599 with six CableCARD tuners and 3TB of space. Next is the Plus, which also has six tuners, but only 1TB of space for $399. At the other end of the price range is the standard Roamio for $199, which only has four ATSC or CableCARD tuners, a 500GB hard drive and no built-in Stream functionality or MoCA. None of the new models support analog cable"
". These limitations are not a big deal for most, but some will be disappointed. Cable-cutters certainly won't be, though; the ATSC model is the box they've been waiting for, as the old ATSC model only had two tuners and didn't support the TiVo Mini."
"The fit and finish of the new box is appealing, with the cheap plastic of the Premiere gone and a nice, textured gray material with a glossy piano-black faceplate taking its place. Oh, the face. Yeah, the TiVo guy on the front of the Roamio doesn't have one, which is odd since he isn't faceless on the remote. The other newsworthy additions are the touch-sensitive power button and a new remote finder button; press it and the remote will start emitting the same music as the TiVo start-up video. The last mentionable change is the recording indicator. Now, there's"
"The new remote gets its own section, but one aspect we must cover here is the lack of HDMI-CEC on any of the new TiVos. We surely sound like a broken record at this point, but this time around should be much louder, as the missed use case is worse than ever. TiVo obviously recognizes the value in moving away from IR, but by not including HDMI-CEC in the Roamio, the new RF remote must still rely on IR for TV power and volume. This creates a somewhat disjointed experience because you can control the Roamio without any regard for where the remote is pointed, but to adjust the volume you must be sure to point it in the right direction. Add in our old points about the prominence of CEC in modern TVs and AV receivers and our dream of being able to turn our TVs on with the great smartphone and tablet apps from TiVo, and, needless to say, we're disappointed. There's the chance that it could be added later, as our understanding is that the lack of CEC in most DVRs has more to do with software than with hardware, but we aren't holding our breath and TiVo isn't commenting."
"The only thing that TiVo releases less often than a DVR is a new remote. The entire Roamio lineup includes the same remote, which means that while the base model also gets the benefits of RF, the top-of-the-line models' remote no longer features a backlight or the ability to learn IR codes (the built-in IR database is very extensive, though). Upon unboxing the remote, we almost immediately referred to it as the stubby peanut -- affectionately, of course. It reminds us of the size of the discontinued "
, but not quite as short. We were happy with the size of the old ones, but the smaller size does make it a bit easier to reach all the buttons. The other big change is the addition of a "back" button.
From left to right: the old TiVo remote, the Glo remote and the new Roamio remote.
"The TiVo user experience still doesn't require a back button; this new addition is for the streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube (the back button provides the same function as the left button while in the native TiVo UI). This is undoubtedly the result of a decision by TiVo to no longer optimize the streaming apps for the TiVo experience. Whatever the impetus, it pretty much squashes any hope we might have still had for a congruous user experience."
"That being said, it does come in very handy when you leave the TiVo experience for another app; it's less jarring than switching inputs. In most cases. The only other notable button change is the front-and-center repositioning of the guide button, pushing the mute and record buttons aside. We find this very odd, as this button is primarily for those who watch live TV first, as opposed to our TiVo experience of going straight to My Shows when we sit down -- TiVo users typically watch less live TV than most. We would've preferred to see the space used for a shortcut to Watch Now or My Shows, but this is likely an attempt to appeal to those not currently using a TiVo."
"The big point of differentiation here, though, is the remote's RF capabilities. No longer do you need to worry about having line-of-sight to your TiVo to control it, which means you can hide the DVR behind closed doors, or change the channel without moving your hand outside the warm and comfy confines of your favorite blanket. The remote does still emit IR, though, but only to control your TV and AV receiver -- as we mentioned before. The Roamio also still features an IR receiver so you can use your old TiVo remote or, say, a programmable one."
"With the new Roamio hardware comes a few updates to the software. The entire user interface has been refreshed, which essentially amounts to a darker, almost black, background instead of blue. The What to Watch Now feature from the smartphone and tablet apps has been added to TiVo Central, but without any configurable options. The really exciting new feature is the long-awaited ability to use the iOS apps to stream and download content from outside the home. This is of course limited by your available throughput, but it's at least easy to set up. It works well enough, but despite having FiOS internet service and LTE on a mobile device, the picture quality of the live stream was still far from what we've come to expect from a Slingbox. We imagine adaptive streaming isn't an easy thing and hope the quality gets better in future releases."
\n            Gallery: TiVo Roamio user interface | 23 Photos\n          
"That is great and all, but it plays second fiddle to our favorite feature of the TiVo Roamio: its speed. Seriously, we can't remember ever using a TiVo this fast. Perhaps we're just conditioned by years of molasses on the TiVo Premiere. No matter. This one flies; it had no trouble keeping up with us in everything we've tried. Does it lag every once in a while? Sure, but the Roamio is faster than the Premiere in every way; from watching something live, we can play a show from the My Shows list within six seconds versus 16 on the Premiere XL4 (that's five button presses)."
"We can't remember ever using a TiVo this fast."
"That new speed helps with more than just navigating the TiVo native UI. In fact, Netflix launches in less than eight seconds, compared to the 40 seconds it takes on the Premiere XL4. Speaking of which, the Netflix and YouTube apps have been updated; there is DIAL support, but the apps are still a little behind as the new Netflix Profiles feature still isn't supported. We also really appreciate the fact that now, when you use the TiVo search to find a show, and then choose to watch it from Netflix, it takes you directly to the show rather than to the Netflix search, like it did before. Much appreciated, no doubt, but we still long for the congruous user experience that the Xbox and Apple TV deliver, as well as all the missing streaming content from services like WatchESPN, Vudu, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Epix, Crackle and CinemaNow. Oh, and it's crazy that the same old, worn-out Amazon Instant app is still being ported along."
ow that we\'re on to the subject of what we don\'t like, let\'s talk about switching DVRs. The out-of-the-box TiVo experience has always left a lot to be desired -- especially when CableCARDs are involved -- but upgrading your DVR should be as easy as upgrading your smartphone. Instead, you have to set everything up from scratch again. At least there\'s the Season Pass Manager on TiVo.com that\'ll allow you to transfer your Season Passes (which didn\'t work for us, but we assume that is a result of our early access). If you\'re lucky enough that your provider doesn\'t mark everything as "Copy Once," then you can at least transfer the recordings, one by one, from your old TiVo to your new one.
"The other enhancement we were hoping for, that sadly isn't here, is a revamped My Shows. What we would really love is a single list of everything we want to watch -- including recordings, live TV and streaming content. But instead, it's pretty much the same as it has been throughput TiVo's existence. We're told there's a new, three-column My Shows view coming this fall, so we look forward to trying that out. We can only dream the user profiles will follow; now that would be a point of differentiation for TiVo."
"Managing six tuners works the same way as if there were two or four. The good news is that with six tuners, you should almost never have to use the conflict resolution, which is in desperate need of a refresh (you can't easily select which of the six recordings you'd like to cancel when you encounter a conflict). You can still maintain a live buffer for each tuner at the same time, perfect for when there are six college football games on at the same time. TiVo Mini fans will be happy to know that you can now dynamically assign a tuner to a Mini for live TV. So not only does this mean you can still record six shows at once when you have a Mini, but now you can also have up to nine Minis configured to your main DVR -- the Mini still does not work with dual-tuner TiVos, though. This may sound like overkill, but really, who ever complained about having too many? The one odd limitation here is that if all the tuners are in use, you still can't join a live session in progress on the Mini. You can, however, still record the show you are watching live in another room and then watch that recording from the Mini. Not exactly intuitive, but it still works."
iVo has never been the least expensive option, at least not up front. The ATSC version runs $199, which is $50 more than the least expensive Premiere, but that still works out to less per tuner and it has the same recording capacity. Speaking of which, the extra $200 to step up to the Pro from the Plus, for an extra 2TB of storage, seems like a bad deal. Any of the models could save you money in the long run, though. The potential savings of the cord-cutting ATSC option is obvious, but even compared to renting a six-tuner multi-room DV
", buying the TiVo ends up being cheaper, assuming you hold onto it for several years. Most importantly, the value of six tuners and plenty of space on a DVR can't be underestimated. Having more space and tuners than you need takes a DVR to the next level, to a point where you no longer have to think when you hit the record button."
It took more than three years, but TiVo has finally delivered the DVR we hoped for when the Premiere first came out. The Roamio Pro addresses every major gripe we had, except the lack of HDMI-CEC. The speed improvement alone makes this a must-upgrade for any Premiere owner, and finally gives all the

"The TiVo Bolt integrates traditional cable and 4K streaming into a seamless, single system. It's lacking a bit in app variety, but if you're a serious TV enthusiast clinging on to cable, the Bolt is near unbeatable in what it offers."
In the early aughts, TiVo pioneered a new technology called digital video recording (DVR) that captured the spirit of watching television. It freed entertainment from the shackles of time, and gave viewers the ability to watch content on their own terms.
It would take nearly a decade for traditional cable operators to catch on and employ that technology in their own boxes, passing those development costs onto subscribers along the way. Then, when DVR finally went mainstream, the industry turned away from cable entirely, making all the work that those companies put into the DVR over the last few years moot.
It might not make much sense, then, for a company like TiVo to continue developing DVRs when the term "cord-cutter" has been on everyone\'s mind for the past five years. It might seem even more confusing to see a DVR \xe2\x80\x93 well, it\'s more than a DVR, but I\'ll get to that in a minute \xe2\x80\x93 cost $299 for a 500GB version or $399 for a 1TB system. (This specific system isn\'t available in the UK or Australia, however TiVo\'s technology can be found in set-top boxes made by Virgin.)
"But the beauty of TiVo's new Bolt system is that it's more than a DVR or a "
Put as succinctly as possible: the TiVo Bolt is your shows and movies, when you want them, where you want them.
"Most of us have anywhere between two and four black rectangular boxes sitting in our entertainment cabinet. They're usually perfectly flat, stack nicely and look like they were designed by the exact same engineer."
But instead of following in those footsteps, the TiVo Bolt has some pretty surprising design ideas, including a sloped top and an all-white shell that houses some seriously fast hardware.
"If you're looking for a size comparison to other DVRs, the TiVo Bolt is 33% smaller than TiVo's own Roamio and 65% smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro. For non-TiVo owners, that translates to 11.4 x 7.3 x 1.8 inches (W x D x H), or roughly the size of a Sony PS4."
"The front, top and sides of the box are all smooth and, for the most part, completely blank. There's an indicator LED and a small TiVo logo on the front, but otherwise the Bolt is a brazenly blank slate."
"Spin it around to the back, and you'll find a Remote Finder button, cablecard slot, coax (Digital Cable, ATSC, MoCA) input, optical audio out, L/R audio, an HDMI 2.0a port for 24fps 4K or 60fps 1080p, a 10/100/1000 Mbps ethernet port, two USB 2.0 and an external storage port (eSATA)."
"(Note: You'll need to reach out to your cable company and obtain a cablecard if you want the TiVo Bolt to integrate with your cable service.)"
he big draws of the box itself are the external storage port (in case you decide to go for the smaller internal hard drive), and the equally fun and practical remote finder to help you track down your pad when it goes MIA. There are enough ports here to run an audio signal straight to your TV and soundbar or simply pass the signal through a receiver and let it do all the heavy audio lifting.
"Speaking of the remote, though, there's little to complain about regarding TiVo's pack-in controller. Most of the buttons will be familiar \xe2\x80\x93 you've surely seen a few dozen numerical pads in your life \xe2\x80\x93 but I found the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons a smart touch."
Features on the TiVo Bolt are premium in both senses of the word. They are both exceptional in their execution in creating one of the best TV-watching experiences on the market, but these features also cost more than you might want to shell out for.
"Let's cover the cost first. A brand-new Bolt comes with one year of TIVo's service for free. Considering one year of TiVo service costs $149, that's a pretty solid deal. After the trial runs out, you can either switch to a monthly plan to the tune of $14.99 per month or opt in to the annual plan for $149 plus tax."
o what does your investment net you? Access to services like OnePass, which intelligently scans the available channels and records any instance of a TV show or movie the next time it plays \xe2\x80\x93 without ever wasting space on duplicate content and prioritizing HD quality.
"If you've ever used universal search on a new "
", TiVo also has a similar function, called Smart Search, that finds every source for the content you're interested in and lists them by price. It currently searches Fox, PBS, AMC, CBS, Showtime, Hulu, Netflix, Vudu, NBC, Bravo, FX, Comedy Central and Amazon \xe2\x80\x93 as well as cable or over-the-air signals \xe2\x80\x93 for the cheapest source of whatever you want to watch."
"But the creme-de-la-creme of TiVo features are SkipMode, which enables you to completely skip over commercials with the press of a button when watching recorded shows, and QuickMode, which speeds up a recorded show by 30% without raising the pitch of the characters' voices."
"They're both tremendously helpful to traditional TV watchers that either use cable or an over-the-air antenna, and will radically change the way you view traditional television. Thirty-minute shows will be reduced to roughly 20 minutes and hour-long epics can be compressed into roughly 40-minute blocks. You can watch three episodes of a show in the time it used to take you to watch two. For binge-watchers, like myself, that's well worth the cost of admission."
"The Bolt is an increasingly competent 4K video player, too. It can currently power its way through Netflix's Ultra-HD library without breaking a sweat, and TiVo says it plans on rolling out Amazon 4K support in the near future. Admittedly, the TiVo Bolt doesn't have the same massive Ultra-HD library as, say, the "
"The biggest fault of the system is that, when it's compared to the other streaming video systems out there \xe2\x80\x93 game systems like "
, Apple TV and Roku \xe2\x80\x93 the TiVo comes in a little light on apps.
"The argument could be made, of course, that most TiVo owners will opt for traditional cable or an antenna, but being able to use apps like Showtime Anytime or HBO Now would allow for more of a customizable experience suited for today's market. (Do check out "
, though, which allows you to stream content you already own from a nearby home theater PC [HTPC] to your TV for free.)
"The TiVo Bolt is an unbridled binge-watching machine. It collects the shows you want to watch in an insanely easy-to-navigate interface and, through the beauty of OnePass, intelligently organizes your carefully managed recordings. Of course, once you do record a show, you'll be able to watch it faster, thanks to features like SkipMode and QuickMode. This means you'll spend more time enjoying your shows and less carefully fast-forwarding through commercial breaks."
etting up additional storage is simple, as is connecting it to a nearby HTPC for Plex.
"Finally, TiVo is finally boarding the 4K bandwagon to some surprising results. It tore through Netflix in Ultra-HD, and the company has plans to take on Amazon's 4K catalog in the coming months."
"The TiVo Bolt is definitely lacking when it comes to crucial video streaming apps. While it has Vudu, Amazon and Netflix, it's missing key services, like Showtime Anytime and HBO Now, that would allow cable reductionists to only pay for an antenna and then stream premium content through the apps instead of a paid cable package."
"Additionally, the TiVo Bolt box comes part and parcel with the monthly service. You'll get the first year of service free when you purchase your system. But payments to the tune of $150 a year, once the free period ends, makes this a tough sell for those looking to save money by cutting the cord."
"The TiVo Bolt does an admirable job in everything it sets out to do. Not only does it perform as one of the best DVRs on the planet by allowing you to record up to four shows at once, but it completely organizes them in one of the most easy-to-use interfaces. Plus, new features, like SkipMode and QuickMode, will make it so you don't waste hours of your life watching ads that you don't care about."
"On top of all that, the Bolt is a competent 4K streaming device, tackling Netflix's Ultra-HD library at launch and setting a course for Amazon's offerings next. It could use a few more apps, like HBO Now and Showtime Anytime, to round out the options for cable cutters trying to scale back their cable bill."
"One problem it can't shake is the monthly fee, though a one-year-free trial helps make the Bolt's $299 and $399 price tag a little more wallet-friendly."
"If you plan on cutting the cord completely, check out the excellent Roku 4. It lacks a cablecard slot, but offers thousands of channels of streaming content of its own. But ultimately, the Bolt is at the top of the table for TiVo, and it's easily one of the must-own products in the home entertainment category for anyone planning on sticking with cable."

"Our son in law told us about TiVo, and how much money they were saving. We decided to cut back on what we were spending on television since most of what we were watching was on the Networks, and on Netflix and/or Hulu. Could not be happier with this product. Put an antenna in our attic and getting all of the channels we need, coupled with streaming tv (with many built in Apps) its perfect. The interface is far easier to use than our old television provider box and the storage pace at 1TB allows for 150 hours of HD recording time. We coupled it with a TiVo mini for our bedroom and don't think we'll ever go back to paying for television again!"

We bought this to replace our 5-year old Channel Master OTA DVR and what a difference!\r\n\r\nWe particularly like:\r\n\r\n1. TiVo service with no monthly subscription cost\r\n2. The ability to record up to 4 programs at once\r\n3. The ability to set up automatic recording of new episodes in a series\r\n4. The commercial skip feature\r\n5. The automatic prompt to consider extending the recording time for live events that may run longer than scheduled (e.g., football games, car races, etc.)\r\n6. The ability to "recover" recordings that were deleted by accident\r\n\r\nThe one missing feature that we\'d like to see is an option for purging all "Recently Deleted" recordings (with an "are you really sure you want to delete all - this can\'t be undone" warning, of course). Currently, completely deleting "Recently Deleted" recordings can only be done one at a time.

lthough there are less expensive options available, the Romaio is an all-in-one solution for those of us who wish to access OTA HDTV and streaming services. Having this device helped ease the transition from being a cable subscriber to a cord cutter. Be aware, however, that there is a learning curve to the user interface and a nudge to purchase shows from additional services.

Great for skipping commercials & dropping cable
"I got this so I could cut the cable cord ($150/mo) and it works pretty well. It does what is is supposed to do regarding working as a tuner and recording scheduled shows. I LOVE the commercial skip option on recorded shows. It works great. I'm currently using an indoor HDTV antenna and most of the local channels come in pretty clearly. They show a 55-75% (Austin, TX 9.5 miles from the towers) power which is fine for watching live TV. But in order for the recordings to work, the power level of the station should be 80+%. Most of my recordings are pixelated or don't work at all. I will have to install an external antenna to get this to work really well. Great for the price with lifetime free schedule access."

Fabulous piece of equipment. In use it every day without any problems. i dont keep any of my equipment connected to the internet all the time because of security reasons. however, this tivo needs to connect it to the internet quite often to keep the tv guide updated as it comes over the internet and not over the air. not that much of a problem as it reminds you to do so. great unit other than that.

Virgin TV V6 box review: Virgin Media\xe2\x80\x99s 4K HDR TiVo powerhouse
4K HDR capabilities, 4K Netflix on-board, cross-platform search, multiroom with other TiVo boxes to share recordings, download recordings to free mobile app, record six channels
iVo front-end user interface looks dated, box really isn\xe2\x80\x99t the prettiest out there, still waiting for the HDR software update at launch
"However, five years is too long for a technological advancement to stay as much. And sadly the TiVo box, even in its more recent 1TB iteration, is feeling the strain. It's not quick enough, quiet enough or sleek enough. Apps take an age to load and even the menu system seems to ponder the meaning the life before responding to keypresses. In short, it has been in serious need of an upgrade for a couple of years."
"Better late than never, though, and the Virgin TV V6 box powered by TiVo is that upgrade. It is smaller, smarter and considerably faster. It also cleverly works with existing TiVo boxes so enhances a Virgin Media customer's experience instead of replacing it."
"There's just one drawback, its tardiness means that\xc2\xa0"
Virgin TV V6 box review: Future-proofed 4K HDR spec
"Funny enough, without Sky Q we doubt we'd have as capable a Virgin Media alternative. Let us explain."
"Virgin TV V6 Box vs Sky Q: What's the difference?"
"The Virgin TV V6 box is a product of hindsight. It does many of the things that Sky Q does, with a few tweaks here and there. There are differences, but customers no longer need to get green-eyed when they visit a Sky customer's home. And if they are into recording shows, well, they can play a spot of one-upmanship themselves \xe2\x80\x93 at least until Sky pushes a forthcoming update to compete."
"That's because the V6 box comes with eight TV tuners, with six available for recordings and two put aside for future development. That means you can record up to six shows at a time, while playing back a previous recording or streaming something over\xc2\xa0Netflix, YouTube or one of the terrestrial catch-up services that are available. Sky is planning to add the same recording functionality to its 2TB Sky Q in a software update, but as yet the Virgin Media device is unparalleled."
"The V6 box also has something built-in that Sky cannot match through software alone: around the back is an HDMI 2.0 port with HDCP 2.2 copy protection support. That means that the box is capable of outputting 4K HDR (high dynamic range) video - the latter after a pending update. Sky Q is capable of presenting 4K images, but its HDMI 1.4 output cannot handle HDR - meaning it'll never be HDR-capable without a hardware change."
What is HDR? High dynamic range explained
HDR adds a wider colour gamut and higher levels of contrast to an image, resulting in more realistic, natural colours and greater detail in both bright and dark areas of a picture. It is a real game changer, and if your TV supports it you might find it to be more visually impactful than the higher resolution of Ultra HD 4K.
he hindsight we mentioned earlier has given Virgin Media the chance to adopt the tech for its box. And while it is yet to implement it with a future software patch of its own, the fact that you will soon get HDR compatibility for Netflix, other content partners and broadcasts makes this box as future-proof as they come.
"It's important too, as when it comes to 4K content Virgin Media does lag behind rivals. At present, you can watch Netflix shows, like The Crown, Stranger Things and Narcos in 4K, as long as you have a premium Netflix subscription (priced at \xc2\xa38.99 a month). Others have Ultra HD footy and films aplenty, so are on a higher rung of the ladder already. Give the V6 box time though and its library will undoubtedly grow. It certainly has great potential for expansion and you'll be happy of that in a year or so."
"What we're less sure of is your reaction to its looks. Up to now, the shape and design of the V6 box is contentious to say the least. It's like the tech industry's answer to Marmite. You either hate it or put up with it."
"We're definitely in the latter category (with the box rather than Marmite, which we loathe). It is smaller than many surmise from press images and the like. It's about half the size of the existing TiVo box and with similar dimensions to a Sky Q Mini box."
"It is fatter for sure, but some seem to forget that it is packed with tech. And we've always been of the belief that a telly box should be hidden in a cabinet rather than exposed anyway - after all, if you're spending time looking at the box, you're missing the point. And your programmes."
"A rounded button on the front glows different colours depending on whether it is on or in standby mode, and that's about the only stand-out feature. We like that \xe2\x80\x93 it is unassuming and easy to hide. And considering it requires quite a few cables plugged into the rear, including an Ethernet internet lead, you wouldn't want to proudly display it on a shelf anyway."
Virgin TV V6 box review: New remote
"Like the main box, the remote has also shrunk. It has a similar design aesthetic to the existing TiVo remote but nicer feel. It is also RF-enabled this time around, so doesn't need to be pointed at the V6 box. That's further proof that you should tuck the box in a cabinet than proudly display it on a silver platter. It doesn't need line of sight at all."
"In terms of functionality, the remote is nigh-on identical in all other aspects to the current version. The same thumbs up/thumbs down buttons are there \xe2\x80\x93 it is still powered by TiVo after all \xe2\x80\x93 although, to be honest, we've never met anyone who has used the suggestions modes\xc2\xa0for more than the first few days after installation."
he fast forward, play, pause, rewind set-up is better placed and spaced, and there is a new search button for the advanced search features now available (more on that in a bit).
In all other respects it is a remote that will feel familiar to Virgin Media customers. We\'d have liked to see some touch controls, like the Sky Q clicker, but they\'re not essential. The V6 remote does have a similar find function, though, where an eight-second press on the "+" button on the box will make the remote beep so you can locate it easily.
Virgin TV V6 box review: Multiroom capable
Free Virgin TV Anywhere app for iOS and Android
You can also control the box through the free Virgin TV Anywhere app for iOS or Android. Using a smartphone or tablet, you can access and set recordings, including Series Link+, play catch-up and on-demand content, watch live TV or switch channels on a Virgin Media device.
he app has been around for years but a recent update not only makes it look prettier, it has gained additional features, with the main one being the ability to view recordings stored on any of your home boxes, as long as you are connected to the same home network. You can also download recordings to your mobile device for offline viewing.
"This is something that Sky Q offers and has been one of the things we've most used since having that particular platform installed. We love the option\xc2\xa0and for Virgin Media to also implement it is similarly a godsend to its customers. There's nothing like having the ability to watch Homes Under the Hammer when on the Tube. Well, perhaps not Homes Under the Hammer, but you get the picture. Literally in this case."
We have found some restrictions due to licensing rights \xe2\x80\x93 specifically with sports events on Sky channels in our case, including WWE shows \xe2\x80\x93 but the vast majority of general content worked for us.
"Virgin TV Anywhere also works well in a multiroom set-up. It can access all of the boxes on your network from the same mobile device, whether they be V6 or original TiVo boxes. And it is here that Virgin Media's new system works particularly well."
ky Q requires additional, dedicated hardware to provide a multiscreen experience: the Sky Q Mini boxes. Virgin Media, on the other hand, has created its multiroom solution around the idea that customers can use original TiVo boxes in other rooms, with a V6 box as the main hub in the living room. Even multiple V6 boxes.
"If you have more than one of either device in your home and they are linked to your home network through Ethernet they will communicate with each other and effectively combine resources to expand either box's potential. An existing TiVo box, for example, can become a bedroom machine and access all of the recordings on your V6 box's hard drive. It also works the other way, with the technology being backwards compatible."
We used powerline adapters to ensure that we could have a wired connection in a bedroom, which allowed us to connect our older TiVo box to the home network. The V6 box requires wired connection anyway, so with both able to talk to each other, they each popped up in \xe2\x80\x9cMy Shows\xe2\x80\x9d as an additional source for recordings. You can then playback any recordings, no matter where they are stored, on any of the devices in your home. It also effectively increases your storage capacity.
he Virgin TV V6 box comes with 1TB of storage as standard, less than the top-end Sky Q box (which has 2TB). However, add a second V6 box or 1TB TiVo box to the mix and you have 2TB to play with too. Add a third and you have 3TB.
"What's more, each box has its own TV tuners, so increases the number of programmes you can record at the same time. In our case, where we had a V6 box and TiVo box in the same set-up, we could record up to nine shows simultaneously - three on the TiVo box and six on the V6."
"Another neat trick is that separate boxes can access and playback the same recording at the same time, yet view it from different points. It's a compelling feature and one that's just as important as 4K HDR compatibility."
Virgin V6 box review: Software and experience
mart search across all content, including Netflix
eries Link+ offers on demand content too
"As you will have read so far, there is much to like about the V6 box. It is technically proficient and crammed with interesting features. The only thing we're less keen on is the menu system."
"As a trade-off for multiroom compatibility with older TiVo boxes, the V6 box has the exact same software running the show \xe2\x80\x93 something that dates it aesthetically. Other systems and services, including Netflix's own front-end that can be accessed on the box, are more modern and just, well, prettier."
"The TiVo user interface has looked dated for a while, with more emphasis on text than cover art and that makes it look bland. It works well and you can find your content quickly and easily, but with so many others offering thumbnail alternatives we can't help but feel it's the slight Achilles heel in the whole set-up."
"Some people won't give two hoots, however. And considering it requires the same system to work so effectively with multiroom, it's a reasonable caveat. Virgin Media also has smart search up its sleeve that helps you find your content faster anyway, ensuring you spend less time in the purple platform as possible."
mart search is excellent. Like some media streamers, such as the 
"If you search for a show on the box, you'll be presented with all the results no matter where it is being hosted. It could be part of UKTV Play's channels, a catch-up service, or Netflix. And if it's the latter and you start the show, it automatically circumnavigates the Netflix app start-up process and starts the programme directly - in the best format possible, including 4K."
We searched for The Crown, for example, and it popped up on the screen as if it was a normal broadcast show. But starting it opened Netflix and jumped straight into the episode. This kind of freedom for content is superb and gives Virgin Media a current advantage over rivals.
"Virgin Media is also the only service that currently offers Series Link+. Like a normal Series Link, which automatically records all future episodes in a chosen series, the V6 box (and TiVo boxes these days) will also hunt down any episodes available on-demand and add them to your recordings list. But as they can be streamed rather than downloaded, they won't take up storage space on your hard drive."
"This also counts with shows you have recorded. You can technically delete them but still keep the placeholder for the on demand version, ready to stream that\xc2\xa0instead. And because the V6 box is lightning quick \xe2\x80\x93 far faster than the older boxes \xe2\x80\x93 you won't even know the difference between the playback of content stored locally or over the internet. That 1TB of on-board space is more ample than it may at first sound."
\xc2\xa399.95 one-off up-front cost for customers on Mix package or above
Or \xc2\xa349.95 one-off up-front cost for customers on Full House or VIP bundle
"Pricing for the box is relatively simple. To get the V6 box you needn't incur additional monthly subscription fees, it's a one-off expense."
"You do, however, need to be on a relevant Virgin Media package as you'll need broadband speeds fast enough to handle streaming 4K content. That means having the Mix package or above."
"Monthly fees will vary depending on your package and content selections, but that's the case with any paid TV service. New customers can expect a discount first year starting at \xc2\xa355 a month (increasing to \xc2\xa376 a month after 12 months)."
"There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that if you are an existing Virgin Media TV customer you should upgrade to the V6 box. It is considerably faster, 4K HDR enabled and comes with an RF remote control that doesn't require line-of-sight to function."
"The fact that the box works so well with an existing TiVo device to provide a multiroom solution should be considered too. It's a great upgrade option for existing TV subscribers."
"But choosing between Virgin and Sky Q will mainly come down to circumstance and personal choice. There is little doubt that Sky offers more compelling content options, especially when it comes to 4K, with its movies, box-sets and live football (plus F1 from the start of the new season). It doesn't have Netflix in 4K though. Nor does it have the ability to output HDR video in future. The Virgin TV V6 box does and that might swing it for the purists."
"We doubt you'd be disappointed whichever you choose. In the Virgin TV V6 box, Virgin Media has created a device that can finally play in the same ballpark as its rivals. And one that can even improve its skills over time."
ky has been steadily improving its Sky Q system over time and its 4K-enabled flagship device will soon get the ability to record six shows at once, matching the V6 box. One main difference is that you need to download on demand and catch-up content rather than stream it, but the extra storage space accounts for that.
ky Q review: 4K, multiroom support, apps and more
Like Sky, BT also generates its own 4K content in the form of live football matches on its BT Sports channels. Its Ultra HD YouView box is currently the only option to view them. It also comes with Dolby Atmos support, which the others cannot offer as yet (Sky is adding it to Sky Q later this year).

o add to consumer confusion, there are cable and satellite boxes, as well as DVR replacements. The options are seemingly endless, and trying to determine which solution best fits your needs is tough.
he TiVo Bolt, however, attempts to be the set-top box that can fulfil most of your requirements. It comes with the streaming applications you\xe2\x80\x99d would find in other set-top boxes, but adds the ability to watch live TV, record shows, and even skip adverts. 
It also has smartphone integration, which should appeal to households that are committed to the world of cable but looking to break away from the living room. The TiVo Bolt is currently only available in the US and only works with US cable providers.

lthough notably smaller than previous TiVo devices, it remains substantially larger than recent set-top boxes such as Apple TV or Roku 4. Worse, its banana-like shape means you have no choice about where you place it in your media centre if you stack devices on top of one another, which is just plain awkward.
he TiVo Bolt is available with either 500GB or 1TB of hard disk storage. I tested the 1TB version, which is enough to store around 150 hours of full HD video.
s with previous TiVos, the TiVo Bolt requires a CableCard, which your cable company should be able to supply. Some companies may charge you a monthly fee for this, however, so it\xe2\x80\x99s worth finding out before you take the plunge.

he Bolt has both Wi-Fi connectivity and a gigabit Ethernet port. The 802.11ac, dual-band Wi-Fi is particularly impressive: despite sitting in my basement, the Bolt easily connected to a router two floors up and delivered a consistent and reliable connection.
he obligatory HDMI port supports the latest HDMI 2.0, Ultra HD-compatible standard making it future-proof even if your current TV does not support Ultra HD content. You also get two USB2 ports and an eSATA port for hooking up external storage, which acts as an overflow for the internal disk.
he Bolt comes with a wide range of streaming apps, including the familiar options you would expect, such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu and YouTube.
etup takes some time, however, so block out an afternoon to make sure you can get everything up and running. The device ships with an HDMI cable, so I was able to quickly plug that into my TV, hook it up to my cable connection through its coax port, and flick it on. Once the Bolt powered on, it was the start of a set-up process that took close to an hour.

After I spent the time plugging the device into my other hardware, I had to provide location information, connect it to my wireless network, and follow the many on-screen prompts to get going. While those prompts were helpful and easy to follow it was still a laborious experience. The Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s remote may work well for a viewing experience, but for tapping around a menu, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pain. Hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll only have to do this once so the pain will be short lived.
here are two ways to get started with the TiVo: via over-the-air broadcasts, which is the quicker option, or by getting a CableCard from a service provider and watching TV through their offering. Since I already had CableCards handy, I opted for the latter. 
he biggest issue with TiVo is that you\xe2\x80\x99re required to pay a monthly service fee. While the Bolt comes with one year free, once that period ends you will need to pay $149.99 per year or $14.99 per month just to keep the TiVo service running. 
he other consideration is that some service providers require that TiVo owners add a tuning adapter, called a switched digital video adapter, to the device. While connecting that adapter takes some manoeuvring of cables, it proved annoying to have to use it. It\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps also worth noting that on-demand channels and other features one would find from their standard cable box may be unavailable, adding another wrinkle.
ervice and setup present some issues that TiVo \xe2\x80\x93 at least right now \xe2\x80\x93 can\xe2\x80\x99t address. And for many, the hassle of the extra adapter and monthly fee will be enough to make them look elsewhere.
iVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Remote, Interface and Experience
he TiVo Bolt comes with the familiar peanut-shaped TiVo remote, although this one has been redesigned somewhat from the TiVos of old. While it is small, it\xe2\x80\x99s still comfortable to hold and both children and adults should have no problems using it.
s with previous models, the remote has a TiVo button at the top, as well as easy access to critical features, such as the Guide, play, pause, and navigation. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s thumbs-up and thumbs-down feature for refining your tastes is also available, providing old-time TiVo owners with some familiarity.
he remote itself is well designed and I had no issue learning quickly where the buttons were placed and how to move my fingers around to find the features I wanted. As far as DVRs go, TiVo is still offering the finest remote on the market.
iVo is similarly top-notch when it comes to user interface design. The company has polished the interface a little, but it still delivers an enjoyable, familiar experience that makes it easy to find programming, search for shows, and flip through menus.
It includes a feature called OnePass (a service that replaced the former Season Pass), which automatically finds and records shows across both live TV and online streaming services. For example, fans of the show Gotham can enter their account information for services such as Amazon Instant and Netflix and OnePass will pull in the series\xe2\x80\x99 shows from all of those as well as your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s own on-demand service (if available) and put them into one easy-to-access place. OnePass is intelligent and convenient, and made both starting new shows and catching up on others simple and elegant.
rguably its most intriguing feature, however, is the ability to skip adverts. SkipMode, which becomes available after a show has been recorded, provides an alert to let you know adverts are incoming. I simply pushed a button on the remote, and I was back to my show without having caught sight of an ad. 
here are some caveats that govern the SkipMode\xe2\x80\x99s use. For one, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available for programmes that run from 4pm until midnight. In addition, it only works on around 20 channels. However, TiVo is expected to expand its partnership with other networks in the future to offer the SkipMode to more channels.
here\xe2\x80\x99s also QuickMode, which I used to skip through parts of a reality show at increased speed while still being able to listen to the audio. It\xe2\x80\x99s particularly useful for catching up on sports events and speech-heavy content as well as shows that perhaps don\xe2\x80\x99t engage your full concentration. The device also comes with the ability to connect to an Android or iOS device, and either download or mirror content to those devices.
s someone who\xe2\x80\x99s been locked in a world of cable for years, not having quick and easy access to on-demand channels was a pain. Granted, streaming apps have made this a little easier to swallow, but TiVo has several gaps in that area that need to be addressed before it can become a full replacement for heavy TV watchers. 
With all of that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find fault in the overall TiVo Bolt experience. Moving around the software was simple and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t succumb to any annoying glitches. The device was able to render the features quickly, its 4K support is a welcome addition, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s own features, such as suggestions and wish list, are still among my favourite for finding new shows. 
iVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Should I buy the TiVo Bolt?
hose in the market for a new set-top box to upgrade their TV experience need to weigh up the pros and cons of switching to TiVo. They need to decide how many services are available, how much value they\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of the device, and crucially, the total cost of ownership. Ultimately it depends on your own viewing habits and the services your cable provider already offers.
For those looking for a DVR experience and want some of the extras that are offered in streaming boxes, the TiVo Bolt delivers. Those who want a wider array of streaming services and don\xe2\x80\x99t care about what\xe2\x80\x99s on TV at any given time, however, will find that the TiVo Bolt falls short.
here\xe2\x80\x99s also the issue of cost. The TiVo Bolt costs $300 for the 500GB model and $400 for the 1TB option. While that cost includes one year of TiVo service, after that, the TiVo-exclusive features \xe2\x80\x93 including SkipMode, QuickMode, OnePass, and others \xe2\x80\x93 come at a cost of $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. Add that to the standard cost of cable television and the monthly fees charged by streaming services, and the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s total cost of ownership starts to soar.
t $300 or $400, the TiVo Bolt may be one of the more expensive set-top boxes on the market, but it also delivers one of the richest and most appealing experiences. Despite its unorthodox design, the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding software, unique features, good performance and plenty of add-ons make it a worthy buy.

Please be aware that TiVo customer service and tech support are notoriously bad. My own experience with them was extremely frustrating: the new Bolt I purchased for $300 soon developed major defects, they sent me a "refreshed" unit with even more defects and I went around and around with them for many months, being continually lied to and misrepresented by their employees (mostly making promises that were never fulfilled). I finally documented all written contacts with them then disputed bogus charges with my credit company - and won! Recommend you check out: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/entertainment/tivo.html. I believe they hope dissatisfied customers will just give and go away, which many do due to the extreme frustration of dealing with this company.

"Loved the idea of the TiVo Box but once we decided it wasn't going to work out for us, we were stuck with making payments for a year. Called to explain why it wouldn't work and they didn't seem to care. I get it's only $15 a month but what a stupid thing to hold on to as a company. Maybe I'd be back, maybe I could find a way to make it work but now I will never use or recommend anyone to use this service. It's too bad."

"Multiple phone calls and no resolution. Very poorly trained staff, who make you walk through a series of troubleshooting steps each time, even though you just did them. The result is that you can never get anything actually resolved in less than an hour. Also, they ask you questions, then don't listen to the answer \xe2\x80\x93 and ask the same question seconds later."
"I purchased my TiVo over 2 years ago and really appreciated it. They appeared to have spent a lot of time on human interface issues, especially searching for shows. I even went and purchased a lifetime subscription. About a month ago, they made some firmware changes and I noticed two new things that really bothered me; - Before the highlight color was yellow and now it's white; the white is much more glaring, harder to read, and annoying. - Before, when I turned on my TV set using the TiVo remote control, I would have to wait for about 10 secs to get video."
t the same time I would get audio AND control of volume and mute. This was particularly important to me because our bedroom is next to my room and if the volume would come on while my wife was sleep it would disturb her. Since I got control immediately, I could hit the mute button and at worst I would get a short chirp if there was audio going on. Now it takes another 10 secs after video, with the audio at the old volume setting, before I would get control which would be enough to wake her up.
"I contacted TiVo for the first time about a month ago, explained the issue and impressed on them that these changes ONLY occurred after their firmware changes. I still had to call them at least 6 times as well as send them emails and they kept putting me off. They had me reboot the TiVo 4 times, they sent me a new remote control, they interrogated my box several times and had me go through resynching my remote control at least 3 times, etc. The first tech that I talked to stated that it could be the hard drive since, from his experience, if the hard drive started to fail it could impact the TiVo - TV communications. I changed the hard drive and it didn't make any difference."
o see if something in my TV set was causing this. I connected my VCR to the TV, powered it on, and I got video, audio, and control of volume and mute all in 10 secs. Identically how my TiVo used to work. Today, after many calls and delays, they finally agreed to replacing the box but it would be treated as a regular hardware replace. They would be generous and only charge me $79 instead of $149. And I had to send in my box and get a return in 1 to 2 weeks. If I wanted to go a cross-shipment I would have to give them a deposit of $499. So, for a problem that they caused I would have to pay $79 and be without a TV in my room for up to 2 weeks.
"I am very disappointed and frustrated with them. If I could be assured that they would really replace my box with a new one, transfer my lifetime subscription, and have everything work like it did a month ago I'd pay the money but I don't have confidence that this would really happen. I no longer have confidence in TiVo since they don't stand behind their product."
"I went out and bought a TiVo Bolt and Mini thinking that would be the answer to my frustration with high cable TV prices. I got the hardware installed and signed up for everything online, give them a credit card number for month by month subscription until I decided whether the service was right for me or not. After a few months I realized that it really didn't give me what I needed. I still had to subscribe to Netflix Hulu Amazon in order to give all of the programming that I wanted and TiVo just didn't seem worthwhile."
"I went online to try to cancel my subscription but after being able to do everything else online discovered that the one thing they won't let you do online have to call and talk to somebody. I tried calling but got frustrated waiting in the queue so gave up. About that time the credit card I was using expired so I decided to simply let the subscription end for non-payment. Now they are billing me for $89 for that nonpayment. When I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay it they turned it over to a collection agency that I am now dealing with. Not to mention a couple hundred dollars of useless equipment. Wish I read the reviews here before getting involved with this awful company!"

"I have been a long time customer of TiVo. Just recently I started having issues with my TiVo Roamio and its HDMI port. I called tech support and they had me go through all the basic steps, which I understand. My TiVo Roamio was deemed 'defective' and support sent me out a replacement. The replacement box that I received was defective and would hardly boot up before rebooting itself. I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again. They deemed that the replacement box was defective, so they sent me out another box. I received the 2nd replacement box and yes, that too was defective. It wasn't an issue with booting up this time, it booted up but the screen was pixelated to the point where it could hardly be read. I started doubting myself here and tested many different scenarios - different HDMI cables, different TVs, etc - nothing."
"I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again (now it's starting to get a little old) - and they deemed this box defective as well. They sent me out another box. Keep track here, this is the 3rd replacement box. This box worked! Was on a brand new (Completely different brand) TV, UPS, top of the line HDMI cable, anything I could think of that would cause an issue like this. After about 45 days - the HDMI stopped working. I called support, I explained the issue, they had me go through all the troubleshooting techniques and they deemed the box was defective. They were just getting ready to setup a replacement and (this would have been the 4th replacement - my 5th TiVo Roamio) and after a brief hold they told me they did not have any record of my support agreement. They must have some record of what has occurred that shows I had a support agreement, right?!"
"The technical representative was very quick to get me off the line and transfer me to a customer support representative who could look into why I no longer had any record of my support agreement, which don't come cheap if you have ever purchased one. When I finally got to the representative on the phone she saw record of my support agreement and couldn't understand why it was no longer on my account. I was placed on hold, and she came back and said I was no longer eligible to receive replacement boxes. She couldn't explain why - I was asking if I had reached a 'limit of liability' of some sort, but one would think that since I was given essentially 3 faulty replacement boxes that even if there was a liability limit that I would not be subject to that clause. After going back and forth, she said that if I wished, I could extend my warranty for another two years - but I was limited to only ONE replacement box."
"This is outrageous. Why would I pay even more money for the chance that yet another replacement box would work? I find it completely unacceptable and disappointing that TiVo would not only offer such poor support, send out non-functional replacement boxes under their warranty program, but not even stand behind the fact that I have a contract with them to ensure my box is working. I would drop the company all together if I hadn't paid for the lifetime subscription on the TiVo Roamio, and purchased 4 TiVo Minis to work with it. I have a lot invested in this system that is still covered under warranty, but TiVO will not support. Absolutely unacceptable. Buyers beware."
"I upgraded a lifetime service agreement on one of my 2 Premier TiVOs to a new Bolt 10 days ago. The sales rep for TiVO, who was NOT located in the USA, transferred the wrong TiVO Premier lifetime service from a machine I still intend to use. Trying to explain this situation to the various foreign representatives has taken at least 20 phone calls to TiVO and, to date, developed 5 different Case Numbers in the past 10 days. I have requested a representative based in the USA to speak to about this issue. The only thing TiVO has done is to close the Cases without ever talking to me, by voice, or email, or pony express for that matter. This company's customer service is a cruel joke."
We have now owned three TiVos. The most recent being the BOLT. It has just failed and is less than two years old. TiVo insists the only way to transfer our purchase of a lifetime subscription is if they ship to us a new one and we return the nonfunctional TiVo. This whole transaction will take 5 to 6 days. We are requesting that we go and buy a new one now and then ship back to defective one, but TiVo will NOT accommodate us. We would have to buy another lifetime guarantee. This is not customer service! We have spent hours on the phone with TiVo going round and round about this with zero customer service, little to no understanding of what we are saying. They LOVE to put you on hold forever hoping you will hang up or go away. If you are in the market for inferior equipment, horrific customer service and wasting hours of your time, this is your product!
"I purchased a TiVo Bolt. I'm on the road all of the time, so I do not need cable or satellite service. The Bolt works great. The problem is the TiVo Mini's. This is the second one they sent me to fix the problem. It is worse than the first one... The problem is... For those of you who work with computer hardware and software like me. If the wifi card is active and the Ethernet port is also active, they will not be compatible. There is no way to deactivate either one... With so many complaints with this product, you will think they can fix it!!!"
My TIVO Bolt worked for 4 months, but has had issues for over 2 months. Calling support results in the same response. "Unplug the unit, Unplug the modem, do this multiple times" while I am put on hold for 5-10 minutes at a time. Then wait 5-10 days and try it again. When asking to speak to a supervisor usually results in a dropped call. The couple of times I got someone, I was again put on hold for 5-10 minutes. I finally got them to send a new unit, which had a different problem.
fter going through multiple calls, they finally agreed to take the new unit back and send another unit. Surprise, the new unit had the same issue as the first replacement. Now I am told it is a known issue and to wait another 15-20 days for a fix. I have had 14 different service log numbers and spent over 4 hours on the phone with TIVO. I purchased a one year contract upfront, which I now know was a mistake. I plan to cancel as soon as possible and never deal with TIVO again. I rated them a 1 only because there was no 0 option. I hope this save someone the aggravation of dealing with this company.
IVO Discontinued My Lifetime Service. What is the point of paying for Lifetime service if TiVo is just going to cancel it whenever they feel like it? I\'m sure there is something in their legal mumbo-jumbo that allows them to do it but they shouldn\'t be able to call it "lifetime" service if it isn\'t. They should call it "lifetime service until we cancel it", at least that would be truth in advertising. Very sad because I have used Tivo for over 10 years and I hate the idea of using another service.
"Like many others on this thread, I had excellent service and luck with TiVo. I have two Series 2 boxes which have run for 10+ years with little incidents. If/when there were incidents, I'd call the TiVo Tech Support line and they'd invariably help me fix the problem quickly and professionally. In February, I got an email saying the Series 2 boxes would not be supported much longer. They had a great offer to transfer my lifetime service onto a new Bolt. I bought a Bolt and a TiVo Mini to connect to the machine. I then got emails saying the supply was not meeting demand and the delivery was on hold awaiting their manufacturer. I got the new Bolt a few weeks later and got it all running with the TiVo Mini. I really liked streaming off the box onto my phone feature because I travel for business. "
"All was working well until a few weeks ago. I spent 10+ hours on phone with TiVo Support and Verizon as TiVo often blames the provider. Then TiVo sent me a replacement box. I got it, plugged it in, called TiVo to activate. It didn't work. Called Verizon. Spent 3+ hours on phone trying to get it to work. Called TiVo back. Spent another 3+ hours. Finally, I plugged my Series3 boxes back in and they work fine. So, after 20+ hours of working on this, I called TiVo and they're refunding my money. It appears these Bolts are just not working."
"Customer for 9 years. Premiere box in 2008, then Roamio Plus in 2014. Premiere died two years ago (hard drive kaput). Roamio is still alive. The interface for the DVR function is fabulous and the recording function seldom fails. But over the years as streaming and wireless connectivity has taken on a bigger role, Tivo has lagged far behind. During that same timeframe I have owned Apple TV (two boxes) and Amazon box. Never ever an issue with them streaming. Tivo not so much. Once a month Tivo box fails to connect with Tivo's homeland to download the TV listings (without which, Tivo can't record). When that happens, you need to check under the hood and tinker because Tivo support only ever has one solution: reboot your router (then reboot your cable modem then reboot Tivo then start rebooting everything again). "
"I don't even know the support phone numbers for Apple and Amazon because I have never had to call them. Tivo offers a link to Netflix and Youtube just like Apple. Choosing the Tivo link instead of Apple is madness - freezes up midway through any show. Same top of the line router, same distance from it. And the Tivo smartphone app? HaHaHa..."
Purchased three (3) TiVo units that are now 3, 4 and 5 years old respectively - all with lifetime service. Approximately six months ago, the channel guide would not download correctly to all three devices requiring a call into customer support. TiVo acknowledges the problem promising a fix but it has only gotten worse. The temporary fix is to reboot the DVR. After contacting TiVo again for the third time with yet another ticket number, I elected to reach out again by phone.
I first spoke with Muriel who then passed me on to her supervisor, Patrick. In the course of our discussion, Patrick suggested, given the age of my 5 year old unit, that problems are to be expected. I argued, "What therefore, is the value of a Lifetime Service Plan if it is only expected to last 5 years?" Flustered, he proceeded to ramble on with a stream of nonsensical gibberish only to hang up on me.
"Patrick's 5 year admission only serves to confirm that TiVo's long term, life time plans are meaningless. Their business model is based on two elements, 1) monthly service fees and 2) selling new hardware. Bear in mind, there's nothing wrong with my hardware - it's a software issue. As a software developer, there's no easier way for a technology company to render a product worthless than by breaking the software with which its hardware is dependent. TiVo does not want their solutions lasting beyond 5 years - consequently, there's no value in purchasing a TiVo."
"I have had a Tivo DVR since the company's launch. I recently acquired a BOLT after nearly 2 months of fooling around with fixing the #3 generation TIVO. I can't begin to describe the hassle I've encountered -- everything from payment to order to technical support. I suspect that TIVO's recent acquisition by a larger company may have something to do with the problems I've encountered. Now after about 3 weeks of use, the BOLT box I installed isn't working and TIVO is mailing me another. I am ready to pull the plug and use the less user friendly but at least less expensive cable DVR. Don't make an investment in this technology unless you're willing to put up with consistent problems across the board. It's too bad as this used to be a very well run company."
"Like other reviewers, I upgraded my TiVo box, then found out a year later I was being billed for two TiVos... I guess this is standard rip off for them. Now I'm trying to cancel my account, they won't let me! Ridiculous! I will have to cancel the card they are billing. I don't know how to prove I'm trying to cancel this. It's outright robbery. Beware."
I canceled my service two months ago with TiVo after 12 years as a loyal customer. Imagine my surprise when I was billed a couple of days ago for the canceled service. I called today to inquire and was told that the first rep had offered me two months of free service as compensation and since I didn\'t call back to cancel before that time was up, my service was continued and I was billed. Let me be clear, the first rep said he was extending free service so that I could "sell the box" and due to my loyalty. He never once mentioned my having to call back into re-cancel. And now they refuse to refund me for this month. This is very, very poor customer service and TiVo has lost a very loyal customer forever.
"When you call the phone number for Tivo, you no longer get a person in the United States. They no longer have any representation here. If you think as an American I am giving my information to total strangers in the Philippines, think again! Tivo has completely gone downhill. Worst company ever. No wonder everyone has billing issues. And they will lie and tell you that no one can talk right now in the States... Do you get this. There is no more USA jobs for Tivo or Tivo support!!! Know how I know, the supervisor in the Philippines told me so!!! Don't buy a Tivo. They are no longer a good company. It is terribly sad. It's all about them getting your $$$."
I ordered top of the line Tivo, Tivo Mini and service. Received product and when I connected, I was told it would not work with my equipment or service. I immediately returned $1000.00 worth of equipment and was told I would be refunded within 10 days of them receiving it. It has been 20 days and still no refund. When I try to contact customer service, I am disconnected. I have tried email and they acknowledge receiving the email but offer no resolution. This is INSANE.
iVo makes it nearly impossible to cancel. They want to bill you forever, even after you\'ve stopped using their service. They let you sign up online, but you can\'t cancel online. I call them and they pretend they can\'t find my account, even though I give them my name and phone number - the info they request and the info my account was registered with. They play games and will probably turn account over to collection agency once it totals a few hundred bucks. The last time I called them to cancel - June 19, 2017 at 14:44, a gal who called herself "Ann" claimed she couldn\'t find my account; refused to give a last name, employee number or any way to really identify her and refused my three requests to speak to a supervisor. BEWARE - CROOKS!
hree months ago I "thought" I was going to "enjoy" Tivo when I discovered the same day of Tivo activation that I had a serious mold issue! Part of the foundation as well as walls and flooring in approximately one third of my home has gone through the long and intricate remediation process of demolition and building! I discovered that my credit card was paying for the monthly Tivo that I had NEVER EVER even had a chance to turn on and watch even a single TV show of any kind!
I called Tivo and asked to have my account suspended as I had this terrible problem! THEY ARE SO GREEDY! No they would not suspend it! They had to cancel for a penalty of 75.00 or I could continue to pay for nothing as well! Very bad customer relation! I think with the loss I have now into this and the BULLY behavior I experienced with this VERY arrogant company that I will just throw this idea away and put it all behind me! I hope anyone who wishes to experience the Tivo service that they research it thoroughly! Very expensive mistake I made in this one sided uncaring company!
When I purchased a new Bolt a year ago, I cancelled service on the old Premiere. I just found out that I have been being charged 14.99 a month for 12 months for that Premiere. Customer support said I never requested cancellation of the Premiere and that I had been carrying two services for the years. They also said they would not refund the money because it had been my responsibility to stop the service.
I want to warn prospective customers that units are expensive, mostly defective and built not to last (tried both Roamio and Bolt). Charged $300 for a TiVo Bolt. Subscription is $14.99/month. Warranty is only for 90 days, after which they try to sell you a "refurbished" unit for an additional cost of $149! Then try to rip customers off further with selling "service agreements". The front green light on my almost 13-month-old Bolt suddenly stopped lighting up. The unit would not respond in any way to the remote. The light on the back was on and I could hear the fan running. I checked online - seems to be a common problem - and went through all the recommended steps, including unplugging the unit, trying to set up again, etc. but nothing worked.
When I called tech support, I was first told that they only offer a 90-day warranty but would send me a "refurbished" unit for a cost of $149. Told them I would not be forced or coerced into paying them AGAIN for a practically new $300 unit. They agreed to send me a \'refreshed?\' unit (with no cords or remote) at no charge. I spent hours transferring my saved programs onto the new unit, with phone help from TiVo. Within a week, the so-called refurbished/refreshed unit started to cut out sound, freeze screen picture and kept losing connectivity with my WiFi (the latter of which was working perfectly with my laptops and printer combo). I then wasted hours on the phone with a variety of tech support and customer service staff. For my "frustration and inconvenience," I was promised a brand new Bolt with attachments. A week later, another "refreshed" unit with no attachments was received.
ince then I have called several times, always maintaining politeness to reps in both tech support and customer service. I was assured that my case would be escalated to a supervisor and promised a call within 3 days - which never came. I called again May 8th, was disconnected several times, even when "escalated" to a supervisor twice (with no call back, despite them verifying my phone number on my account). Bottom line, they sell you an expensive product, charge you a monthly subscription fee, and don\'t give a damn about selling a lasting product or customer service.
I am not writing this to be vindictive, but to warn others not to get sucked into this giant scam. Yes, it\'s a good service - WHEN IT WORKS! Do NOT trust a "refreshed" unit - both a replacement Roamio and Bolt were defective from the start. They also make every effort to get customers to pay another 50% of the cost of a new unit that was only purchased 13 months prior.
"HDMI Input stopped working a couple months after purchase. I called TIVO who not only refused a refund, they charged me $75 to cancel my service early! Terrible company! They know this is an issue (Google it!) and they are scamming people that bought one. Don't EVER do business with TIVO!!"
We have always liked TIVO for 10 plus years until we bought the Bolt and this is a disaster. We are disgusted with TIVO. After a month of not programming properly and TIVO not answering any questions about their problems they finally sent out an email saying the problem was fixed. After doing all they asked we find out they messed up yet again. I would like to know if they are ever going to get this problem with recording one passes. We are so very disappointed in them.
oday, my TiVo Mini just refuse to work. It was working fine yesterday, but today, nope. I tried to do some troubleshooting myself, but it would not work. I called tech support and, after about 30 minutes of unplugging everything, etc., etc., the tech guy said I had to replace the Mini. I believe it is barely more than one year old. So, I have to pay $79 to get another one, but they will not send it out until I Fedex them the broken one. So, this process will take about a week during which time, obviously, no TV service in the main room of the house.
With what they charge for their equipment and service fees, I expect a better quality product. Or, if something happens, I expect them to make it work ASAP and not wait until I find a box to mail them a faulty piece of equipment. I could use the box the replacement is coming in - IF I COULD GET IT. And, as a further insult, TiVo has already charged my credit card for the full amount of the replacement - which is not being sent to me. I will never recommend TiVo to anyone and am considering getting another service, myself.
I have had a TIVO Roamio for a couple of years and have really enjoyed it. I decided to purchase a TIVO Bolt. I started the activation process and found out that I would be committed to paying the monthly price regardless of whether or not I used it. It is absolutely ridiculous that you must purchase their hardware (which would be useless without a subscription), and then be held to pay on a monthly basis regardless of use. I wonder if Donald Trump owns a share of this company. It\'s something he would do to take advantage of people with limited income. I told the "advanced" customer service representative that I did not agree with the terms and he hung up on me. 
"I am returning the TIVO Bolt to Best Buy (letting them know why they need to take the device back) and I am going to find out if I will be committed to a year subscription for the Roamio I currently have when the current year expires. If so, I'm done with that. If more customers refused to be held hostage, TIVO would get a clue and treat us with some respect."
"Terrible customer service and product support. After 2 different TiVos and 4 different cable cards I am still receiving a V52 error. Tivo customer service was rude and condescending. Although this is a known problem with TiVos they act like I'm the only one that has ever had this problem, which is completely untrue. They should not sell a product that they cannot honestly support. Really too bad, this used to be a great company. Unfortunately, not anymore."
Happy customer for over 10 years. I was really surprised to see all the negative reviews. Tivo has state side support and always seem friendly and helpful to me. They stand behind their product better than most companies. But it does come at a price, you buy the equipment and pay a subscription.
"I have no idea how far to go with the horrid support. I have been a Tivo owner since 2004 and simplicity has been the reason... That is gone. I literally lost 2-3 weeks of my life due to a defective unit. Not only did it not work until it was replaced over two weeks later (I requested it be replaced right away) but they insisted to be patient and keep downloading updates even though as long as it was hooked up I couldn't use my tv at all... Two weeks of no tv and missed shows and spending most of my time forcing updates or calling and playing games is absurd. My time is valuable and obviously tivo doesn't seem to care. I even got one support agent talking down to me and literally gaslighting me. No one should get that from tech support."
"The only reason I even got a replacement was because after the abuse I Insisted on talking to a manager as my desire to return it was ignored. He sent one out asap. I asked about a previous unit that was supposed to come to me a week earlier and it was never sent even though support kept claiming it was on its way. They also kept insisting a new unit wouldn't fix the problem even though a new unit worked perfectly out of the box. I lost weeks worth of functionality, time and stress I didn't need."
"It's not too much to ask a company to respect your time is valuable. My time lost could have bought 10 bolts... this refurbished one... which I only bought due to the discounted price wasn't worth it. It's working fine now but I feel compromised keeping it. I just don't want to fight with them anymore. When it expires I highly doubt I will ever use tivo again. If you get the runaround DON'T play their game. Insist on returning it or getting a new one ASAP and insist if it doesn't arrive in time to take it back. Although I doubt they will. You'd think they respect your desire to return things but I can't force them to live up to their legal responsibility without a lawyer."
\n                    TiVo expert review by Jonathan Trout\n                
iVo first appeared in 1999 with the DVR. Today it offers the TiVo BOLT, a streaming device that turns your TV into a smart TV by integrating your favorite streaming apps like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and more. The BOLT comes in a 500GB, 1TB and 3TB storage capacities. That comes out to be about 75, 150 and 450 hours of show and movie storage capability. Pricing starts at $199.99 for the 500GB BOLT, $299.99 for the 1TB and $499.99 for the 3TB.
\n                                You have three options when it comes to TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service plans. You can pay a monthly service fee of $14.99, an annual service fee of $149.99 or an all-in service plan for a one-time payment of $549.99. The monthly plan comes with a one-year commitment and a $75 early termination fee.\n                            
"\n                                By using the TiVo BOLT box instead of your cable provider's box, you can integrate your cable TV subscription with your streaming services subscriptions and puts them all in one place. This lets you avoid monthly rental and DVR fees from your cable company.\n                            "
\n                                SkipMode on the BOLT makes sure you never have to watch commercials again. Not only that, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have to fast forward commercials again. One button lets you skip a whole commercial break and resume your show exactly where it picks up again.\n                            
\n                                4K UHD TVs are slowly creeping into the market as the next big thing. TiVo BOLT is 4K compatible so you can get all the clarity, color and detail your new TV offers.\n                            
\n                                TiVo BOLT lets your record four shows at once for up to 150 hours of HD programming (for the standard model). Watch your recorded shows on your TV or your mobile device.\n                            
\n                                You can stream content from the TiVo BOLT on up to ten TVs as long as you have a TiVo Mini for each TV ($150 each).\n                            
\n                                    people who want to integrate their cable subscription and streaming service subscriptions in one place.\n

450 hours of HD recording space. Six tuners. 4K output to UHD TVs. Speed viewing and commercial skip functions. OneSearch and OnePass combs both broadcast schedules and streaming services.
"Pricey. Digital cable only. Curved design isn't practical. "
he Bolt+ is an upgraded DVR for TiVo power users who want 4K support, six tuners, hundreds of hours of recording time, and are willing to pay a high price for it.
"While having to use a CableCard won't come as a surprise if you've worked your way up from the "
"Once installed, you can use the system's tuners to record up to six programs simultaneously, watch one and record five other programs, or watch multiple shows simultaneously on "
"The lack of OTA recording is one of the main differences between the Bolt+ and the previous model. This means that a digital cable subscription is required, and you won't be able to record free TV content from an antenna. That shouldn't be a problem for anyone looking for six tuners to keep up with the tens of thousands of programs available on digital cable, but it's worth mentioning."
"The TiVo Bolt+ has a 3TB hard drive, good for 450 hours of HD or 3,000 hours of SD video. That's six times more than the 500GB Bolt ($199.99) and three times more than the 1TB Bolt model ($299.99). It matches the storage space on the Roamio Pro, but the Bolt+ is noticeably faster when navigating the TiVo interface, and supports 4K. You can add 1TB or 150 hours of HD video using an external "

"We were able to quickly install a CableCard, but activating it for use with premium channels involved about an hour of back and forth with Fios technical support on Twitter and on Verizon's online chat with a tech. Your mileage may vary depending on your cable provider and specific situation, since it only took about 15-20 minutes for the same procedure when we tested the "
"Like previous TiVo boxes, you need to subscribe to TiVo's service for guide information, remote access, and updates. The service costs $14.99 monthly, $149.99 annually, or $549.99 for the All-in Service Plan (lifetime service). Choose wisely, but note that a Bolt+ with All-in service will cost you $1,049.98 on day one."
"If you opt for the monthly or annual service, you get TiVo's Continual Care Protection, which is an extended warranty. If you have problems and your TiVo goes offline for more than 90 days, the company will send you a replacement unit for a nominal charge of $49. Continual Care is unfortunately not available with the All-in plan. We still think the All-in Plan is worth it if you're planning to use your TiVo for more than four years, but note that you'll still need to continue to rent the CableCard from your digital cable company for that time."
"The TiVo interface hasn't changed a lot since when we reviewed the original Bolt, so see that review for a more detailed description of performance and features. Briefly, QuickMode speeds up the video while correcting the audio pitch so people don't sound like chipmunks, and SkipMode lets you skip commercial breaks with the push of a button. Like last year's model, "
"When we tested the Bolt, it included support for Plex, Vudu, AOL On, Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio Netflix, and Amazon. You can now add HBO Go and Hulu to that list, as well, which pretty much covers all of the major streaming servies. Other apps are available through the built-in OperaTV store, including Facebook and Accuweather, with more services expected to come in the future. That means you likely won't need to connect an additional "
"TiVo's OnePass service lets you search for programs on Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix, so if you missed previous seasons (or even a recently broacast show), you can now go back and stream it from those services. You'll need to be a subscriber, but it's still a boon for the impatient."
"The latest software update for Roamio-class models includes features like OnePass, QuickMode, and SkipMode, so you don't have to upgrade to the Bolt or the Bolt+ if you just want those features. And 4K support is nice, but only if you have a 4K "

In a perfect world, everyone would have TiVo. Gone would be the hours of frustration spent while you railed at your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR that had managed, 
, because the late-Sunday Packer\xe2\x80\x99s game went into overtime and, God-forbid CBS ever just 
, and you knew this would happen; but the only options your dumb box gave you were \xe2\x80\x9cRecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCancel\xe2\x80\x9d so you had to just trust that it would 
"\xc2\xa0know that it needed to timeshift things when the schedule got all f'(ootball)ed-up."

But the hardware is secondary to the amazing software package you get with the TiVo Bolt. After living with it for a few weeks, I would find it practically impossible to go back to anything but the Bolt. For those of you on an older TiVo box, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice right away that the interface has been cleaned up considerably, with a Live TV window in the corner and suggested shows running along the top. The menus are responsive and all settings are much more accessible than in previous versions of the OS. What\xe2\x80\x99s particularly noteworthy is OnePass. The outdated Season Pass feature is gone. I loved it because it let me catch every episode of a show, no matter when or where it aired. But inevitably I would miss an ep and be stuck rifling through Netflix or sifting through VuDu or Amazon. OnePass takes those two paradigms, recording live television and streaming video, and mashes them together. Now, I can see a listing of all the seasons and episodes of a OnePass show, along with\xc2\xa0where I can get them from. VuDu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime are currently supported on the Bolt (Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry! HuluPlus is coming too!). This was an absolute life saver when I managed to delete the only\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0show that daughter was interested in watching.
QuickMode is an essential feature on Sunday at my house. My son is a consummate football geek. He wants to listen to every second of commentary and pore over every replay. Me? I just want them to snap the ball already. Usually this meant I would fast forward through all the cruft between plays, right up to the snap, allowing me to watch the game in a fraction of the time. After all, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two kids and the schedule to match, fitting in three hours of football is an unheard of luxury. QuickMode lets us both get what we want \xe2\x80\x93 it speeds up the playback to 30% of normal, which is just enough to considerably compress the time it takes to watch a game; but still leave all the commentators intelligible \xc2\xa0(well, as intelligible as they ever were\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s not a 
kipMode is the Holy Grail feature for the Bolt. Having used TiVo for the past decade, I have a deep-seated dislike\xc2\xa0of commercials. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how being able to fast forward past them practically whenever you watch a show considerably lessens your tolerance. In fact both of my children, when confronted with live television for the first time, were gobsmacked when I explained to them that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just fast forward past the commercials to get back to their shows. The Roamio introduced a dedicated 30-second skip button, which made jumping past commercial breaks a matter of a couple of presses (and some guessing). The Bolt retains that button; but adds the ability to skip past the commercials entirely with a single press. SkipMode is\xc2\xa0the closest thing you can get to a streaming video experience for recorded television and it\xe2\x80\x99s glorious. It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten so I practically refuse to watch anything live anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather wait the hour or so for SkipMode to be enabled for the show. It\xe2\x80\x99s available on nearly every Prime Time show and its commercial-free nirvana. My only wish is that this feature could be enabled across the entire TiVo line (and on\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0show)\xc2\xa0so that I could use it on my Mini.
he elephant in the room is that the Bolt requires you to sign up for a service package (or buy a lifetime subscription for the unit). However, it does comes with a free year of service \xe2\x80\x93 so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to decide if the greatest DVR ever is worth the $150 a year (They do offer a monthly plan, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not offered up front and it\xe2\x80\x99s $15 a month, which is kind of a \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d after a year of free service). The nice thing is that you can recoup some\xc2\xa0of those costs by turning in your cable-provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR and renting\xc2\xa0a CableCard from them instead. In the end, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a far superior experience for less cash per month.
, depending on the capacity you choose. My advice? Spring for the more expensive 1TB model, get a TiVo Mini for your other TVs, and let the Bolt be the media streaming device for the whole house.\xc2\xa0Speaking of, there are huge streaming plans in the works for the Bolt. Currently, you can stream your recorded shows in-house to your phones and tablets. But the addition of out-of-home streaming is coming, which means you can get anything your Bolt can access\xc2\xa0
I was a big fan of the software refresh that came out for the Roamio last year and figured the Roamio would be the last TiVo I bought for a long time. When the Bolt was first announced, I was skeptical that TiVo could do much more to improve upon their model. I have happily been proven wrong. If you watch TV, you need a Bolt. it\xe2\x80\x99s that simple.

Were you in any way paid for this favorable review?
iVo provided me with a Bolt, as I noted in the review. But just because a company offers an item to review does not guarantee them a favorable article. The opinions expressed in the review are my own. 
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a TiVo subscriber for over 10 years. I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of their products.
uto refresh on a page that users can leave comments?  Wow, talk about bad design  My long comment went poof on the refresh
Hey! Sorry about that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a per-article setting that I usually catch and turn off (since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been caught by it too and it\xe2\x80\x99s ULTRA annoying). I\xe2\x80\x99ve made sure that the auto-refresh is off now. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!
I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of lousy cable/Fioptics DVRs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at buying a Bolt since it came out. But I want aa remote Mini with it, and realized that it requires a hardwire network connection, NOT wireless. That\xe2\x80\x99s not possible for me.
eading further, you can use coax to set up a network \xe2\x80\x93 MoCA. The Bolt can create such a network, but the Bolt must be hardwired into the router \xe2\x80\x93 also not possible for me. You can buy a $50 MoCA to define network\xe2\x80\xa6
o it\xe2\x80\x99s not simple, unfortunately, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made the investment yet.
I can appreciate that. Setting up the MoCA network over coax was the part that gave me the most trouble. Of course, that was due as much to my poor networking skills as anything else.

his bolt is great for antenna users. The interface is fast and easy to use. Having netflix built in is a great plus as well. Easy to set up. Worst part is having to have subscription plan.

Great way to get rid of cable box
"I get all my cable channel with a cable card. I can watch live TV or my recorded shows via the app on my phone or table from anywhere. I don't like that it must be recording to watch via app, but I just delete the recording later. Saving so much $$ getting rid of my DVR box and service."

I just started using TiVo this year! I liked it so much, I bought one for my parents. The only thing is, I wished I tried the amazing TiVo experience sooner. If you are only using an antenna like me, I notice that the picture on the TV was way better after connecting the antenna to the TiVo Bolt. No fussy channels and everything is FHD. Definitely the best features TiVo has are the fast play, SKIP, and OnePass. Stop over paying cable providers to rent their hardware, and start living the TiVo experience.

"I bought it because my cable company no longer offers a dvr with a 30 second skip feature. You can set this baby to skip 30 seconds or to ffwd 30 seconds, which ever you prefer. It also has commercial skip for most popular shows. It also has prime, Hulu, Netflix and several other apps. The wifi is a little weak, but it's super fast if you connect it to your router with a network cord. My only regret is not getting the bolt plus with the 3 tb hdd. Don't hesitate, you will love it."

Make sure your cable is compatible with TIVO.\r\n\r\nDid not enjoy the service.

his box has only 4 tuners and 500GB... Tivo Service is too expensive and I missed the 15 day return policy, so now I am stuck with a $200 paper weight!! The Bolt+ with 6 tuners and 3TB might be worth it but the service is still just too expensive $15/monthly or $550 for lifetime of the box. When the box dies, the lifetime subscription goes to heaven with it.

"First time Tivo buyer. Great product that comes with numerous built in streaming apps. The DVR function was the main feature I was looking for. Features skip mode for those who don't like viewing commercials while watching recorded programs. Also has quick play where you can watch recordings at 30% faster time with adjusted audio. Some issues with set up that were a result of cable card problems but finally got that resolved."

xcellent product, easy to use for a non tech person.

Worked for two weeks, now black screen, no picture. Spent 58mins on the phone with customer service and they wanted to send a replacement. I told them "thanks but no thanks" returning it this weekend. Yes, I tried two other HDMI cables and a different TV. No joy.\r\nBy the way, they want $15/mo. to be able to record and view TV on top of your providers cost.

Much better performance than previous Tivo models. My only complaint is the monthly Tivo service charge combined with a monthly charge for the cable card from the cable provider.

his is my third Tivo and my first after a long absence. Welcome Home Tivo! All the great features I remember with a ton of modern app streaming options, plus the addition of my two Tivo minis give me a great home entertainment system

"Not easy to set up on cable system. This is not a plug and play. Cable Co's know little about pairing systems, networks. Took 3 Tech visits and another 4 calls to cable Tech Support to properly pair the system (under Spectrum). TIVO support is a joke, still using India...good luck understanding dialogue and getting an cogent answer. However, equip is quality and once set up properly, works fine. Does take investment in time to learn features (which are excellent), and how to use. Good news is don't have to pay for a cable box anymore...but a suggestion, would discuss any problems related to installation and/or channel lineup with tech support SUPERVISOR (not an agent); and be aware surprisingly many if not most Techs know very little about TIVO."

Works as advertised, excellent picture quality, I like being able to watch live TV and record multiple shows at the same time. The menu is easy to use and setup was a breeze.

\n    Jefferson Graham reviews the TiVo Bolt, an all in one DVR + streaming device on #TalkingTech.\n    
iVo Bolt is a combo DVR, streaming media device and replacement for your cable box.
MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0TiVo Bolt is\xc2\xa0a DVR. It\xe2\x80\x99s a media-streaming device. It\xe2\x80\x99s a replacement for your cable box.
"It's actually all of those, as well as a pricey all-in-one unit geared toward\xc2\xa0the TV lover in a big way."
"After spending several weeks watching, recording and finding programming via Bolt, I never want to go back to renting my\xc2\xa0Verizon FIOS set-top box again. And unlike the new (and less expensive) Apple TV, or other streaming boxes from Roku and Amazon, the Bolt offers a major consumer plus. You don't have to change the TV input settings to bring on the streaming. Everything is tied together."
iVo imagines a world in which broadcast, cable TV and streaming media apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime all live in one universe, and if you were to search for a TV series like 
\xc2\xa0on the Bolt, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find entries for CBS, local syndication or streaming on Amazon Prime.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s program guide is more viewer-friendly than what I get on my cable box, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to read and more colorful, and finding my taped shows takes fewer clicks than with cable.
iVo threw in a bunch of fun features to sweeten the deal. A \xe2\x80\x9cskip\xe2\x80\x9d button automatically jumps over commercials, taking you from the first segment of the show to the second. It\'s\xc2\xa0a total blast. Fine print alert, though: "skip"\xc2\xa0only works on 20 channels, the broadcast networks and selected cable channels such as AMC, Food Network and Comedy Central, and with shows that have aired from 4 p.m. to midnight.
It wasn\'t that long ago that the broadcast networks were up in arms about technology like this, when the Dish Network introduced the "Hopper" to skip ads. But with TiVo\'s "skip," there has been barely a peep.\xc2\xa0To access the feature with\xc2\xa0TiVo, you need to look for the "SKIP" tag on your recorded show, and then once it starts, hit the D button on the remote.
Via TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s terrific smartphone app for Apple and Android devices, you can watch recorded shows on your device\xc2\xa0within your home network, or just use it as a remote to change channels and adjust volume.
Like streaming boxes from Apple, Roku and others, the Bolt has a collection of entertainment apps \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Vudu and others, but the offerings are skimpy compared to others. TiVo says other apps will be joining the lineup, including HuluPlus and potentially HBO Now.
"Unlike the new Apple TV, the Bolt can show programming that's been presented in ultra-high definition 4K\xc2\xa0via the Netflix and Amazon Prime apps."
"One feature TV lovers should get a kick out of is\xc2\xa0TiVo's suggestions. Once you start recording shows, TiVo begins to figure out your tastes\xc2\xa0and records other shows. For instance, once I asked TiVo to record every episode of "
". (Not that I specifically wanted them, but what the heck. They're nice to have.) But what if you buy the entry-level $300 unit with 500 GB storage\xc2\xa0and don't want these shows clogging up your hard drive? TiVo says not to worry \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0your suggested shows will be deleted first when TiVo looks to make room for the shows you go out to record."
iVo Bolt review from USA TODAY TalkingTech
Finally, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at price. The Bolt starts at $300, but includes one free year of Tivo service, which is $15 per month.
"Still, that's twice as much as an Apple TV or about three times the cost of a Roku."
"Those boxes, of course, can't record shows\xc2\xa0or give you a guide to what's playing on TV."
In this day and age of on-demand streaming, do we still need program guides and DVRs?
"There's a lot that can be watched at one click. But there's still plenty that can't always be seen this way, such as\xc2\xa0complete newscasts, sporting events\xc2\xa0and shows like the aforementioned "
"I like having a DVR and really like the commercial skipper. Plus I love the idea of replacing a cable box with a unit that isn't owned by Verizon."
"It's not cutting the cord, but shaving it a bit."
I give Verizon $420 yearly to rent two set-top DVR boxes. But with the Bolt, I was able to request a \xe2\x80\x9cCableCard,\xe2\x80\x9d which continued to give me service without having to rent Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s equipment.
My $420 got whacked down to $120 a year \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0$5 a month for each card and now the bottom line is a yearly savings of $150.
poiler alert: Cable companies are notorious for being tough to deal with when the "CableCard" is requested, and my experience was no different. It took many calls, tweets and eventually two visits\xc2\xa0to make it work\xc2\xa0for simply inserting a card in\xc2\xa0a TiVo box. But Verizon had to activate it.
With the CableCard\xc2\xa0finally installed and TiVo Bolt running the show, TV is more enjoyable, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to change the TV input to go back and forth between cable and the streaming box. And\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sending Verizon less money.

lthough TiVo remains the best TV-watching experience out there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room for improvement. Parts of the experience are stuck in a time warp and feel like no one has touched them since the days when TiVo relied on dial-up. TiVo is oh-so-close to perfect that I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see them cross that finish line.

Can I watch live TV on my mobile device while watching another program on the TV?

Why does the DVR start recording when I try to watch a live show?
\r\n\t\t To watch a "live" program the TiVo Premiere Q (Multi-Room TiVo) must first start to record the show on the hard drive. This may results in a slight delay of the show.  You can catch up to the "live" time by fast-forwarding this show.

"\r\n\t\t You can watch up to four shows simultaneously on four mobile devices in your home. However, you will need two TiVo Premiere Q's (Multi-Room TiVo) to support four streams.  One TiVo Premiere Q will support up to three streams. Watching four shows simultaneously also depends on the bitrate of the source recordings.  For example, you may have difficulties streaming four high bitrate HD programs at the same time."
"Will there be parental controls similar to TiVo's TV interface for Stream content?"
"\r\n\t\t No.  Currently, the TiVo Stream does not recognize TiVo's parental controls.  Therefore, it is possible for a minor to stream a show from a TiVo that was restricted by parental controls.  It is up to adults to monitor a child's viewing of TiVo recordings on mobile devices just as they would for any Internet video content.  We recommend putting a password on the mobile device itself."

Hi there. When I try to open the Netflix app on Tivo I get the following error message
etflix_Ph5 is currently unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes. (A01)
"It has been like this for a while and I've rung Virgin but they said to ring Netflix who didn't recognise the error message and told me to turn off the Tivo box wait a bit and turn it back on again. I have done this but the error message is still the same.\xc2\xa0"

etflix so slow to load through Tivo
etflix so slow to load through Tivo
"Any reason why Netflix takes an age to load through the Tivo box? \xc2\xa0I can watch Netflix wirelessly on my iPad with no issues loading up at all, however through Tivo you might as well go do something else whilst it's loading. \xc2\xa0Any quick fix for this?"
e: Netflix so slow to load through Tivo
How long is it taking to load?
It may take time due to the content that needs to load inside the Netflix app.

If I purchase a TIVO from Direct TV, will I be able to access Amazon and Netflix?.\xc2\xa0 Also, will I be able to access recordings from my other 2 mini direct tv units?
o. \xc2\xa0The DirecTV Tivo is based on the old Series 2 Tivo software, so it does not have any of the modern "smart" features of the current Roamio or Bolt Tivo DVRs. \xc2\xa0 And you won\'t be able to access any of its recordings from your other "mini" DirecTV units.\xc2\xa0

o, are there any advantages to having the Tivo?
"Not really. \xc2\xa0Unless you really prefer the old Tivo user interface, it's now a very outdated design. \xc2\xa0I'm surprised that DirecTV still even provides them.\xc2\xa0"

Has anyone one or more Tivo boxes noticed that they can no longer connect to their Tivo service for updates with either a hard-wired ethernet connection or wireless connection.
he error message that I get when test my internet connection from the Tivo to Tivo service is
12/28/2015
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
"Contact Tivo support, this is not a Comcast TV equipment issue. \xc2\xa0It is a Comcast internet issue on the west coast and some other area's."

e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
eems to be impacting west coast TiVo users mostly on Comcast although I think one Cox user chimed in. Seems to be an MTU issue somewhere so lowering the MTU on your router to 1450 should allow the TiVo to connect.
I\'m a Tivo customer in the San Francisco Bay area and my box has not been able to reach Tivo servers for over 72 hours. \xc2\xa0Tivo reports that this is only an issue with Tivo customers in the Bay Area who are connected via Comcast Internet services. \xc2\xa0Some Tivo users in this situation are resolving it by connecting through another internet service provider (ISP) which confirms there\'s a problem with Comcast\'s internet service. \xc2\xa0Can you please investigate this and add me to the list of customers impacted by the problem?"
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
"I'm having same issue and I live in the SF Bay Area. \xc2\xa0 My TiVo shows last successful update was 12/29/2015. \xc2\xa0 Since then it continues to fail. \xc2\xa0I also can't use the Netflix streaming app in my TiVo (Series 3). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0"
"This better get fixed soon because there are some new season passes I need to set up for programs which air on Jan 13 but I can't do it because the 2-week programming schedule is too old and won't update. \xc2\xa0Maybe I'll use a phone connection as last resort."
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
"Just to add my voice to the chorus, I've been having similar issues since 12/29. The best thread covering this is on the TiVo Community Forum:"
Consensus seems to be that this is an issue with TiVo, with perhaps some contributing factors that can be blamed on Comcast. Hard to know exactly where the blame lies, but for most folks the only courses of action seem to be
(2) Wait for TiVo to sort it out.
"For those handy with a router, the above thread also includes some instructions for a workaround that involves changing some technical router settings. (Note that for Apple users with a AirPort or Time Capsule, the\xc2\xa0workaround doesn't apply, and there doesn't seem to be an alternate solution, so those users remain out of luck for the moment.)"
I have 4 TiVos which have all been unable to connect to TiVo service - also attempted to install a new TiVo for family member which failed.
hank you for contacting TiVo Customer Support.\xc2\xa0 I would be glad to help you with the network.
Comcast in the California area has sent out an update that caused ports in their routers to close. Those will need opened again in the router settings. Here is a list of the ports that need open.\xc2\xa0
Past that Comcast is aware of the issue and working on it. Do make sure to have Comcast open a trouble ticket for a faster resolution, and so they are aware of how many is being affected by this.
I am now working through getting ports opened.
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
I have the same problem as do a couple of other folks I have spoken to in the Bay Area.
I have spent hours on the phone with TiVo and Comcast.
oot of the problem was a policy push to home routers which blocked the ports used by TiVo.
I believe this happened around 28th Dec. \xc2\xa0 This was info from TiVo. \xc2\xa0Comcast have not indicated any awareness of this problem....
he list of required ports for TiVo is long. \xc2\xa0(Inbound, outbound, and LAN side are all specified on the TiVo website).
"I'd like to understand the content of the changes made by Comcast during this last push. \xc2\xa0"
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
In this case, this does indeed appear to be a comcast issue affecting ONLY Comcast subscribers using TiVo in CA.
e: Tivo service cannot connect via Internet connnection
"This problem has started occurring again\xc2\xa0for me. In the interests of not double-posting, I'll refer to the updated details in the Tivo Community forums:"
"In short, I'm getting connection errors when trying to get guide updates. The error (N18) is the same one that occurred last time (when the problem was identified as a Comcast network issue). Rebooting the TiVo led\xc2\xa0to a successful connection, but the subsequent scheduled connections failed twice for me."

I have a brand new TiVo HD which allows me to view instant Netflix on my television. My wireless network is upstairs, whereas the TiVo is downstairs. My upstairs computers are wired, so I think the Airport device must remain upstairs with them.
"The good news is that the picture quality of the instant Netflx programs is jaw-droppingly awesome! The problem is that the audio on most of the films contains a digital 'stuttering' sound. The Netflix website suggests a USB cable to remedy the audio issue. But what would I connect it to? Again, the computers and the TiVo are in different parts of the house."
"I am wondering if connecting the Airport Express device to the TiVo would 'boost' the wireless signal to the TiVo, and perhaps result in better audio quality. "
ny suggestions on how to solve this audio issue are welcome.

low Netflix Speeds on TiVo Wired to Orbi Satellite
"I have an Orbi system set up with the router in my basement, Satellite 1 on the first floor and Satellite 2 on the second floor. Wireless speed is pegged at 120 Mbps down for devices where I can measure speed (iPads, iPhones, HP desktop, lenovo laptop) when connected to satellites or router. Wired to\xc2\xa0Satellite 2, with wireless adapter turned off on the desktop and laptop each show 1Gbps connection and internet download speeds pegged at 120 Mbps. Here's my issue. I have a TiVo Bolt+ wired to Satellite 1 and a TiVo mini wired to Satellite 2 (both with cat6 cables). Through the Netflix app on the Bolt+, I consistently see 33 Mbps download speed wired AND wireless when I disconnect the cable. Through\xc2\xa0the Netflix app on the Mini, I see 6 Mbps download speed wired. Has anyone else seen speed download limitations with TiVos connected to Orbis in this way? Any solutions?"
\n\t\t\tModel: Orbi High-Performance AC3000 Tri-Band WiFi System (RBK50)\n\t\t
e: Slow Netflix Speeds on TiVo Wired to Orbi Satellite
"It's quite possible that 6 Mbps is all the throughput the processor on the TiVO is capable\xc2\xa0of managing. \xc2\xa0This is adequate for a single HD video stream, which is all the device is designed to handle. \xc2\xa0Manufacturers don't usually overdesign devices like this, because it adds unnecessary cost."
In any case, if you consistently get 6 Mbps and there are no problems watching TV, then you have nothing to worry about.
"If you want, you can check to make sure it's not your network by unpluging the Ethernet cord from the Mini, plugging it into a laptop or desktop, and running a speed test. \xc2\xa0"

"\n                    A friend of mine has TiVo and is interested in the Netflix service on there but he doesn't have internet but I've told him I could setup an email address for him. I think he just wants the 30 day trail tbh but would he be able to cancel via his TiVo when his trail is up or would he have to do it via a computer?                "

"\n                            You can't cancel from the TiVo but I think what you can do instead is cancel your friend's membership as soon as signing up, so your friend wouldn't have to do anything himself to prevent getting charged after the trial period. I've mentioned this before but this is a nice setup VM have done for those wanting Netflix without the need of internet.                        "

"\n1 Sign up on the web page using an email address, password and credit card. Click on the free month trial. Once they are satisfied you haven't had a free trial before they will email you within seconds to tell you that you have a free month's trial."
\n2 Log back in and cancel.  The web site will tell you subscription will not be renewed after the following date (one month ahead).
\n3 Open the Tivo app (or Channel 204) and sign in with email and password.  Tivo will remember these details and you will not have to sign in again (unless you want to watch Netflix on another device).
\n4 The Tivo uses its own internal broadband for the streaming and it will begin with a basic picture. As it realises it has a decent broadband speed, picture gets better. Max pic quality is Super HD (1080p) - if you want to see the progress of the better picture press INFO on remote.
\n5. Finally if you do want to sign out of Netflix (maybe to watch a film at another home) then once it has opened with the film choice menu, ignore what happens on the screen as you press keys on your remote that takes you to the log off page: UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT,LEFT,RIGHT,UP,UP,UP,UP.

"\nBeen my mates today and he's signed up without a valid email address. He just typed any email in and then just entered his bank details and Netflix excepted it!!!"
"\nI gather they will take payment as the email address doesn't even exist?"
"\nWhy is that a problem? If he didn't want to join, why did he give his bank details? Was this a month's trial he signed up for?  If so, he really needs the phoney email address to cancel it but he'll still get a free month.   If he can't remember the email address he will have to phone them to cancel.   Seems odd behaviour especially as there are sites which allow you to use a temp email address for an hour or so."

\nI think you need to get your box replaced because it is excellent on my Tivo box. It only takes about 10 seconds to give me full HD on a stream and loads quickly. It also gives you Dolby Digital 5.1 sound as well. So it is certainly worth it.

"I've heard about people having US accounts for Netflix. How is this done?"
\nThe accounts are not geographically locked down. So your account can access any netflix server regardless of location.

"I've heard about people having US accounts for Netflix. How is this done?"
\nYou have to use either a US VPN or a DNS server which has been edited to reroute netflix lookups (google netflix dns)

"\nI wasn't exactly going to find a million different posts on every user that has issues.  In my living room I can access netflix via my tv, tivo, wii or xbox (from the devices connected to my tv) out of all them the tivo is deffo the slowest.  Starting a program isn't really the issue it's the actual loading.  It takes an age to present you with profiles and then a further age to show you the media catalogue after that.  Out of all of them the xbox is the fastest logging in and doing on the above much faster.  This isn't down to network performance it is purely the speed of the processor in the tivo is quite pants really."

\n                            We just signed up to Virgin and the Tivo box is a confusing piece of kit. But I am gradually picking it up.
\nHowever, Netflix on it is awful. Very hard to get to like. Takes forever to set up and to load and when it does it keeps buffering and pausing and never playing more than a few seconds before I just give up.
\nMy box was set up by Virgin only 10 days ago and I have not been able to watch more than 30 seconds of anything on Netflix before I have to get on with my life.
\nIt is badly letting the side down for my impressions of Virgin as a newbie.

iVo update brings new Netflix, YouTube apps, parental controls
More than just your Instant Queue and an ugly interface, the new apps allow you to search and discover content.
"TiVo's been on a roll with keeping its promises lately (though I probably just jinxed it by saying that). First, it updated large sections of the HD interface in January, and then it actually started "
rolling out Comcast Xfinity On Demand support
, and now comes a software update with shiny new apps for Netflix and YouTube. 
"\n\nWell, new to TiVo users anyway; they're very similar to the apps you'll find on other streaming-media devices. "
"Each one takes several seconds to launch and connect. However, they're no worse than the previous versions, and you get much more functionality and an HD interface, like the one for Hulu Plus. "
\nAlso in the software update is the completion of another section of the HD interface: parental controls. These can now be turned on without sacrificing the rest of the HD interface. (No new 
\nLastly, that rollout of Xfinity On Demand support I mentioned up top,

"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThread where people are seeing on mini's"
\nI think many people just give up on YouTube w/Tivo and use a different streaming device.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy Bolt will play YouTube until the inserted commercial.  It almost never recovers after that.  If I jump ahead it will sometime buffer again and resume playing.  The Mini's work fine.  For extended youtube viewing I've returned to my pre-TiVo media device.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are definitely issues with the Tivo YouTube app. I also get the 'Loading' message, and often (maybe every time) after this recovers, the video starts in the middle and won't let me go back to the beginning, and also the timer/location tracker will get stuck where it's at and not advance with the video. Fortunately I have a smart tv with a great YouTube app that I can fall back on but I'd rather not have to. The main selling point of the Tivo to me was never needing to touch a second remote.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFYI-  I contacted Tivo tech support.  The instructions below seemed to have fixed mine.  
Uncheck YouTube- From TiVo Central > Settings & Messages > User Preferences > My Video Providers
iVo Central>Settings and Messages>Network Settings>Connect to TiVo Service Now. 
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWell, that was short lived.  It ran fine for maybe 10 videos.  Now back to LOADING...
\nI am now seeing a recurring theme as I get help from Tivo Tech support- "Reboot and everything will be OK"
\nI am losing faith that the Bolt is the answer to my cordcutting needs.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI am in a few Cordcutting groups and the TiVos are looked down on especially since Tablo, HDHome Run and other OTA DVR's were released.  I even contacted TiVo and asked about support for more cordcutting apps like Sling, DVTN and Vue and they said no plans at all right now.  Your better off with a $30 FireStick for streaming over any TiVo like your finding out for yourself right now."
\nIf I did not have lifetime on my Bolt, I would have gotten a Tablo DVR long ago.  It is just so much better for us Cordcutters and OTA.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"I am in a few Cordcutting groups and the TiVos are looked down on especially since Tablo, HDHome Run and other OTA DVR's were released.

I keep tabs on cord-cutting as well.  Some of the devices/software solutions you mention are not a bed of roses either.  I have read about many problems.  I had Media Center for 8 years.  I really liked it, but there was always some issue popping up.  That did not go over well with the wife.  The one thing I can say for the Bolt is that it just works.  Uh, with the exception of the youtube app.  
"\n As I see it,  Tivo is in the business of selling DVRs and the annual service subscriptions.  Why would they ever want to bring an app like Sling and their cloud DVR to the Bolt?  With a cloud DVR and Sling what would you need a Bolt for?  The Bolt itself has performed pretty well for me.  I am, though, disappointed in Tivo's commitment to streaming apps.  They appear only to be a sideline they feel they need to include to attract buyers."
\nI am glad I did not buy the lifetime package.  This will be a big year for streaming services.  You take that $30 firestick along with Sling TV DVR, Netflix, Amazon...  it will be my final solution.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI wonder if the main issue is one with whatever y/t srvr the tivo is pulling from combined w server hosting the video. Or a bitrate thing. I've seen this type of wonkiness w y/t on the computer before as well. And sometimes is video specific."

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI read above to do these procedures below to stop the "loading" issue on Youtube, but it still does it.  This hasn\'t been a constant issue but it has happened many times in the past, today it\'s happened twice in an hour.  There is really nothing that I know of that fixes the issue.  If I abort the app, then return to Youtube it seems to solve the issue for awhile, say 30 minutes or so.
\n Tivo tech was contacted about this a year ago by me but they said it was a Youtube issue, well then that doesn\'t explain why this issue only happens with my TIVO Bolt and no other method when I use Youtube.  I use Youtube a lot, so this "loading" issue frustrates me.  Maybe TIVO can use their weight with Google to figure out what the problem is?

oes Youtube Live TV service work on TiVo?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWell, I just got notified that the new Youtube Live TV service is now offered in my area (Atlanta). They are offering a free month (then $35/month). While it doesn't appear to offer quite as many channels as some of the others (Turner networks are missing), it does have a fairly good selection along with live TV of ALL our local networks (NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS) & a so-called cloud DVR service."
"\nWhile I may give it a try, I was wondering if this service will work with the Youtube interface on my TiVo Roamios? I'm not seeing it mentioned in their devices so am thinking probably not. Just wondering\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSorry, no. You Tube TV uses its own app, separate from the main YouTube app. Right now, it's only on mobile devices and the only way to watch it on a TV is via Chromecast.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou're never going to see a cable replacement streaming app on Tivo, IMO.  I am surprised that they never wanted to do this for the OTA-only boxes though.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's too bad because TIVO is becoming a dinosaur and will have to evolve. I thought that when they announce the Bolt they were going to become an all in one Streaming and content solution. Sadly it seams they are locked into the old school cable box mentality. Everything is moving to the cloud and even traditional cable services are coming around to the fact that the old days of distributing over cable is moving to the internet."
\nWhen my current Tivo Roamio dies I will not replace it with another Tivo. Instead I will look into something like the Tablo or similar setup that will allow me to use my FireTV or Roku Apps in a one box solution. I no longer subscribe to traditional cable and rely on OTA and Streaming apps. I do not even really need a DVR all that much anymore because most stuff is available on demand or I can DVR my programs in the cloud.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOr you could get a universal remote, and every app/source would be one button press away.
"\nProblems with on demand are limited availability and unskippable commercials, tons of them. I'll stick with Tivo where I still have at least some control.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWas really excited to begin using TIVO.  Was tired of renting my DVR.  Unfortunately, I really want to cut the cable at the same time and found out Youtube TV does not work on TIVO.  This is a really bummer.  I would pay anything to get away from Comcast!\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYouTube TV is designed to replace your TiVo not be used with your TiVo.\n\t\t\t\t\t

"If you're really interested in YouTube TV, you should do the free trial. Understand that, right now, they don't have a YouTube TV app for any TV-connected devices like Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, etc. So you would use their app on your Android phone/tablet or iPhone/iPad. Then you could cast whatever you want to watch to your TV if you have a Chromecast or an Apple TV connected to the TV.

"If you're really interested in YouTube TV, you should do the free trial. Understand that, right now, they don't have a YouTube TV app for any TV-connected devices like Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, etc. So you would use their app on your Android phone/tablet or iPhone/iPad. Then you could cast whatever you want to watch to your TV if you have a Chromecast or an Apple TV connected to the TV.

"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI hope you are correct about a Google YouTubeTV app for the Roku. What I cannot understand about my TiVo Roamio is that the regular YouTube app ALLOWS me to cast to the TiVo. However, the YouTubeTV app doesn't see or recognize the TiVo (??????). I just bought a Roamio last month (after the demise of SimpleTV) and I really LOVE it ! However, I live in an area with hills and my OTA reception can be so-so on some stations. I'm trying YouTubeTV to see if I can overcome this reception and to see if their dvr is good for me ... I LOVE to time shift ! I have a 2nd gen. Chromecast for another TV, but would prefer it for my main TV. We'll see ... work in progress ....\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"Casting doesn't actually send video from your phone/tablet/computer to your TiVo, it sends instructions to start the YouTube app and play a certain video on your TiVo.  So the net effect is you are still limited by the YouTube app on your TiVo.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently, took advantage of a TIVO offer to upgrade my Premier unit(s) to a Bolt. Like most, I am always exploring value based options.  I don't hate Comcast or blame them for wanting to make a profit. They are however, certainly taking advantage of their market position in my area with zero competition.  YouTubeTV represents a disruptive force that stands to change this dynamic.  Accessing YouTubeTV from a TIVO would be far more convenient than dealing with my phone/tablet and a Chromecast device.  Memo to Google and TiVO - work together and add value to your products and services!!\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSo far YouTube tv is gargabe,  there is no 8-10' app on any platform to use with a remote. all point and click\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYouTube TV has tweeted that they are currently "working on perfecting" native apps for both Android TV (Nvidia Shield TV, Mi Box) and Roku, although they couldn\'t provide an ETA. But they had said some time ago that they expected new apps to arrive this fall, so maybe we\'ll see those platforms supported soon.
YouTube confirms a YouTube TV app for Android TV and Roku are in the works - Pixel Spot
"\nGiven Google/YouTube's historically strong support for Apple devices, I would bet they're currently working on an Apple TV app too. Fire TV will probably not be supported, if I had to guess, due to the ongoing estrangement between Google and Amazon. Fire TV doesn't even have an official YouTube app.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

In short you can pair one or more Phones or Tablets to it and use it to queue and play videos. Its all very impressive stuff.

Open the internet browser on your device and go to youtube.com/pair , you should get the mobile version which will ask for a Pairing Code and a name.
Once you have done that when you go to play a video from the YouTube mobile website you should see a little red screen symbol. When you start the video it should display on the TV rather than your device.

fter yonks with a super-slow set-top box, the V6 is fast and now in 4K. However, with few new features and little exclusive content, multi-room is the only thing to get excited about. 
For a company that\xe2\x80\x99s obsessed with its broadband speeds, the wait for Virgin Media to upgrade its 
o the arrival of the new V6 set-top box is something of a relief. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost always super-fast, and will instantly remove any frustration existing Virgin Media TiVo customers have with lagging. Ten times faster than that previous black box of doom, it comes with a 1TB hard disk as standard (no 500GB option this time) and can cope with 
"The V6 is tiny. Measuring a compact 230x153x55mm and weighing 1.04kg, it will easily fit under \xe2\x80\x93 or even alongside \xe2\x80\x93 any TV. Inside is 3GB RAM and a Mediatek OctaCore, while on the rear is an HDMI 2.0a output with HDCP, an optical audio output, a 3.5mm mini-jack for analogue audio, and a Ethernet LAN port. There's also a USB 2.0 slot marked 'for future use'."
Virgin has kept the rear ports simple on the V6
"Installation is pretty simple; the engineers will do it for you. However, if you're going to keep your old Virgin Media set-top box \xe2\x80\x93 and I recommend you do despite how slow it is \xe2\x80\x93 it's worth knowing a few things. During the installation we (the engineers and ourselves) found that the V6 is instantly compatible with Powerline, the system that allows you to send data around your home\xe2\x80\x99s electricity cables. Excited? You should be. If you do have Powerline plugs, or if you have Ethernet LAN points and/or routers around your home, you can network the V6 with your old set-top box. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible you want the old Virgin Media set-top box out of your sight immediately, but if you can live with it in another room, do so. Why? You get to watch recordings made on either box in either room.\xc2\xa0"
here are two kinds of remotes for the V6; new hardware and a slightly improved smartphone app. The former is a lighter, sleeker version of the old TiVo remote, which now uses radio frequency (RF) instead of line-of-sight infra-red (IR). That tech also powers a \xe2\x80\x98find me\xe2\x80\x99 option \xe2\x80\x93 hit a button on the set-top box itself and the remote will beep.\xc2\xa0
"The other option is to use the TV Anywhere app, which users of the old Virgin Media set-top box will be familiar with as being by far the quickest way to do anything. It's lost its speed advantage, but searching TiVo and manipulating recordings remains easiest on the TV Anywhere app.\xc2\xa0"
"The TV Anywhere app also enables two phones or tablets to work as a \xe2\x80\x98second screen\xe2\x80\x99 for watching some channels live over WiFi (notable exceptions being HD and +1 channels) and even the watching and/or downloading of some recordings. However, in practice the recordings don't always always play on a phone \xe2\x80\x93 the app just hangs \xe2\x80\x93 and in our test we were unable to download anything but episodes of Aussie soap "
". So don't bank on making recordings on your V6 to later take away with you; it's technically feasible, but practically impossible. \xc2\xa0"
he new remote now uses now radio frequency rather than infra-red, meaning it can work without line-of-sight.
"The apps allows remote recording when you\xe2\x80\x99re away from base, and it works really well. However, because it zeroes itself every time there\xe2\x80\x99s an app update, or if a phone has an update, there\xe2\x80\x99s often a huge amount of admin involved seemingly every time you use it. We found we only needed the app very occasionally, usually when we were out with friends who'd mention something \xc2\xa0on TV we meant to watch. That\xe2\x80\x99s no time for data-entry and password-retrieval emails.\xc2\xa0"
"It's also worth knowing that the SeriesLink+ feature (discussed later in this review), which lines-up links to all kinds of on-demand content besides manual recordings, is absent from the TV Anywhere app.\xc2\xa0"
"There are plenty of apps on the V6, but they're time-consuming to find"
"Apps on the V6 are generally mediocre. They\xe2\x80\x99re time-consuming to find while you\xe2\x80\x99re watching TV, but at least the many button-presses and cursors slides are far quicker than before. Loading times for the likes of Netflix, YouTube and all terrestrial TV catch-up apps such as the BBC iPlayer (alongside dozens of apps you will never use) and quick enough, though the grid you have to trawl through does feel outdated. We've also had an occasional issue with the BBC iPlayer app refusing to load, which took us back to the pre-V6 days.\xc2\xa0"
"There's also an issue with navigation; years ago, the Netflix app was installed as a red button app to channel 204 on the TiVo EPG. A classic stop-gap, yet that\xe2\x80\x99s still the quickest way to access Netflix. There's no Amazon Video app \xe2\x80\x93 blame the Fire Stick for that \xe2\x80\x93 though Virgin makes surprisingly little of its Sky on-demand content, which is fully integrated into the V6.\xc2\xa0"

iVo Roamio Pro review: this is the ultimate cable\xc2\xa0box
here is nothing more instantly dangerous to the average relationship than screwing up the TV.
It\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact, crystallized in 50 years of jokes about remote controls: who\xe2\x80\x99s holding it, how complicated it is, how many there are. Unlike almost every other piece of technology in your home, the TV is shared space, and the delicate politics of that space are potentially explosive. The TV industry moves slowly because it understands this; the early adopter curve is forever depressed by arguments over glitchy interfaces and missed recordings that are really just proxy battles for arguments about distance and commitment and doing the dishes.
hese were the thoughts going through my head late last Saturday night as I struggled to install the new TiVo Roamio Pro, a $599 DVR that lets you record 450 hours of HD programming on six channels at once, and stream it all to iPads over your home Wi-Fi. (And soon, over any Wi-Fi anywhere.) It also has Netflix, Spotify, and a YouTube app with basic Chromecast support. It is a remarkable and ambitious product, and very likely the best cable box ever made.
But until my Cablecard activated correctly, it was just a dead box sitting under a blank TV, threatening my marriage.
he Roamio Pro is the top of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s 
, which also includes the $199 Roamio and the $399 Roamio Plus. The Roamio line (or TiVo Series 5, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a TiVo nerd) is a big upgrade over the outgoing TiVo Premiere lineup, with faster processors, support for more tuners, and integrated streaming capability in the Plus and Pro, which also \xe2\x80\x94 finally \xe2\x80\x94 have built-in Wi-Fi. All three models get a new version of the classic TiVo "peanut" remote that works over RF for faster response times, and features a wonderful and hilarious new Remote Finder feature that has the remote play a little song when you tap the icon on the front of the Roamio. All of this is housed in a redesigned chassis that\xe2\x80\x99s smaller and more power-efficient than your average cable box.
he Roamio only works with standard cable TV service and Verizon FiOS, not satellite or AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s U-Verse. Installation is theoretically quite simple: call your cable company and ask for a Cablecard, which usually costs a couple bucks a month, and when you get your TiVo you insert the card, call the cable company to read off some activation numbers, and then settle in for a night on the couch. If you have FiOS, it\xe2\x80\x99s even simpler: you can activate a Cablecard online using a six-digit code that comes in the box.
But Cablecard is a notoriously fickle technology, and installations can range from trivially simple to panic-inducing nightmare. Installation experiences "vary wildly," says TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Denney. "If you get the right person it\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite easy." But sometimes even the right person can\xe2\x80\x99t help.
hat\xe2\x80\x99s how I came to find myself at home alone on a Saturday night, cursing Verizon for screwing up my Cablecard install so badly that I went from having a perfectly functioning TiVo Premiere to no television at all within 15 minutes of calling the automated activation number. After another 45 minutes on the phone reading long strings of numbers to an enthusiastic support rep, we both realized Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s computers had thoroughly mixed up my various Cablecard and device numbers, and that the only real course of action was to ship out an entirely new card and start over when it arrived on Tuesday.
hat would mean missing the season premiere of 
, so in the interest of saving my marriage I dug our unused FiOS cable box out of the closet and hooked it up. After a series of reboots, mysterious clicking sounds, and interminable firmware downloads, I was presented with an essential truth TiVo owners often forget
Most cable boxes are complete pieces of garbage.
fter just three days of dealing with Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s unreliable, confusing, and frankly user-hostile FiOS DVR, switching to the TiVo Roamio Pro was an incredible relief. (Installation with the new card went swimmingly after a phone call to re-activate HBO.) Just using the Roamio for basic TV-watching is a huge upgrade over a cable company DVR and a noticeable upgrade over previous TiVo units \xe2\x80\x94 not only do you get six tuners and endless recording space, but everything is ridiculously fast. TiVo says the Roamio line is up to 2.5 times faster than previous models, and it shows: things like setting up recordings and deleting shows take just seconds. The UI responds instantly to the new RF remote, making it feel even faster. The interface has also been tightened up: it\xe2\x80\x99s darker and sleeker, and moving towards a much flatter look.
Irritatingly, TiVo still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t converted the entire interface to HD \xe2\x80\x94 there are still old-style SD screens throughout the settings menu, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining about for at least three years. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t anyone at TiVo just spend a weekend fixing this? Denney laughs at me. "I have that conversation with the engineering team all the time," he says. "It truly is a matter of prioritization." Note to TiVo: this needs to be a priority.
he speed increase also means that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s discovery interface is finally useful as well: the Roamio suggests programs you might find interesting in a bar at the top of the main screen, and you can also look at what live shows are popular right now, as well as what\xe2\x80\x99s on in various categories like sports and movies. These features have been standard on TiVos for a few years now, but they were so slow I never used them. Now that they work well, I find myself using them constantly.
In fact, the Roamio works so much better than a standard cable box I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t engage with all of its other features \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ll get more out of your expensive cable bill because you\xe2\x80\x99ll record and watch more interesting TV than before.
But there\xe2\x80\x99s lots more to the Roamio Pro than top-tier DVR functionality. The integrated search indexes across Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant Video in addition to TV, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just a few clicks to watch or record something once you\xe2\x80\x99ve found it. The Netflix app is the shining star of the bunch; it\xe2\x80\x99s now much faster, and runs on Netflix\xe2\x80\x99s latest platform so it\xe2\x80\x99ll get updates as Netflix rolls them out.
Closer to an integrated TV solution than anything from Apple, GOogle, or Microsoft
he latest update? The Roamio supports the DIAL standard used in the Chromecast, which means you can find a movie on your smartphone or tablet and send it directly to the Roamio to watch. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very compelling \xe2\x80\x94 the Apple TV has been my go-to Netflix device for years, but the Roamio is quickly taking over.
Other apps like Hulu Plus and Spotify are fine \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re not great, but they\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly serviceable. Interestingly, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s making a big bet on HTML5 TV apps; the Roamio actually runs the Opera browser engine. The first HTML5 app is YouTube, which is just Google\xe2\x80\x99s familiar leanback YouTube experience.
It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly slow \xe2\x80\x94 TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Denney says "the reality of HTML5 is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not built for performance" \xe2\x80\x94 but it works, and it supports Google Cast from the YouTube app on smartphones and tablets, which means you can send videos from your phone or tablet to the Roamio by clicking one button. It takes a second, but it works \xe2\x80\x94 and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to switch inputs or launch an app to make it happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, but the Roamio is closer to a complete integrated TV solution than anything from Apple, Roku, Microsoft, or Google. There are some key apps like HBO Go and Watch ESPN missing, but hey \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ve got cable. You can just record those channels.
he potential here is obviously enormous, and Denney says TiVo will continue to look at expanding Cast support \xe2\x80\x94 including support for tabcasting from Chrome if the demand is there. "Traditionally we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been focused on how to bring a browser experience to the TV, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll contemplate it," he says. "Especially if we get feedback that it could be interesting. The platform is capable of a lot."
But while TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s moving quickly on the new Netflix app and the future of HTML5 apps, the Amazon app is an embarrassing relic. While movies and shows themselves are in HD, the menus and interface are all in jaggy SD \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ll even switch your TV to 480i if you don\xe2\x80\x99t lock the TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to HD. Key features like search and Prime Instant Video are just missing.
It\xe2\x80\x99s a glaring hole in an otherwise-complete TV product; Roku and Apple TV offer a far superior movie and TV rental and purchase experience right now. There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be an update on the horizon, either: Denney says TiVo needs to "get Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s full cooperation" to move forward. "Hopefully HTML5 support will move that along," he says. "It is what it is right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to update it."
his really could be your only box
mazon ugliness aside, the Roamio does all the things you\xe2\x80\x99d expect a competent media streamer to do. Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most expensive media streamer ever, but when you consider that it\xe2\x80\x99s also a fully functional cable DVR, things start to make more sense. This really 
nd there are still more tricks in the bag.
orry Android fans \xe2\x80\x94 streaming is iOS only
Last year TiVo released the TiVo Stream, a tiny box that let you stream and download video from a TiVo hard drive to an iPad or iPhone. This year Stream functionality is integrated into the Roamio Plus and Pro \xe2\x80\x94 if you install the TiVo app on your iPad or iPhone, you can stream or download shows when you\xe2\x80\x99re on your home Wi-Fi. You can even stream live TV with a slight delay. It\xe2\x80\x99s great \xe2\x80\x94 you can basically use an iPad or iPhone as a second TV when you\xe2\x80\x99re at home. You can also download shows to watch them offline, which is nice \xe2\x80\x94 although the file sizes can be a little too big.
he streaming features are going to get better: in the fall TiVo will add support for out-of-home streaming, letting you watch what\xe2\x80\x99s on your TiVo from any Wi-Fi connection. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi only \xe2\x80\x94 TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s still working on meeting Apple standards for low bandwidth streaming on mobile networks, but Denney says a future update will address the issue.
I was able to beta-test out-of-home streaming, and it worked fine for light use \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not as seamless as a Slingbox or the Dish Hopper with Sling, but it certainly does the job. I noticed a slight dropoff in audio and video quality, but nothing major. (TiVo recommends you have at least a 1 megabit upstream connection for the best performance.) The only thing missing is Android support, and TiVo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t announced anything yet.
he TiVo app also lets you manage and control the Roamio remotely \xe2\x80\x94 I schedule shows using my phone when I\xe2\x80\x99m out and about all the time, and I much prefer looking at the guide on my iPad and tapping to change the channel instead of interrupting what\xe2\x80\x99s on the screen to click around with the remote.
If you have multiple TVs in the house, you can add $149 TiVo Minis and link them to the Roamio, allowing you to watch recorded programs everywhere in the house. You can also watch live TV on a Mini if you give up one of the Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s tuners, but an imminent software update will allow the Roamio to dynamically assign tuners as needed, which will make everything work much more seamlessly.

"Outrageously expensive but worth it if you're paying for cable"
he TiVo Roamio Pro is very much the ultimate DVR \xe2\x80\x94 short of building a media center PC, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t another product on the market that can do as much with as much flexibility as the Roamio. Installing it can be a huge pain, and it\xe2\x80\x99s outrageously expensive \xe2\x80\x94 on top of the box, TiVo service costs either $14.99 / month or a ridiculous $499 flat fee per unit \xe2\x80\x94 but if you\xe2\x80\x99re spending loads of money on cable service with premium channels, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it. You will record more shows and movies and watch them in more places with a TiVo than with your cable company\xe2\x80\x99s DVR, hands-down.

Virgin Media adds YouTube to channel listing, sits between CBS Drama and Yesterday
"Virgin Media has given its YouTube app on the company's TiVo box its own channel. Go to channel 198 now and you'll get a portal to zip straight through to YouTube without having to hunt it down in the app section of the menu system."
"Unfortunately, that doesn't mean you will get links within the channel listing itself. But it does make access that bit easier. In addition, the service has been more deeply ingrained in the Search and Browse and My Shows areas."
It is free to access for all TiVo customers.
"The distinction between different types of entertainment - from channel schedules to On Demand TV, from linear broadcasts to online content - is blurring all the time," says Peter Chapman, associate director of content acquisition at Virgin Media.\xc2\xa0"By giving YouTube a place in our channel listings we\xe2\x80\x99re breaking the mould of the traditional EPG and giving our customers even more choice in how they can watch the great content on our platform."

Virgin Media Tivo and V6 box review: is it worth it?
Virgin Media Tivo and V6 box review: is it worth it?
"VIRGIN has recently launched a new upgraded box for their TV customers: the Tivo V6 1TB box. Here's what you need to know about the features, prices and how it compares with the older Tivo."
he new Tivo V6 box offers 4K Ultra HD viewing and is 10 times more powerful than the older Tivo box, which should alleviate complaints of previous sluggish performance.
V6 doubles the storage of the older box to 1TB, allowing customers to record up to 500 hours of standard definition programs, or up to 100 hours in HD. 
nd in line with Tivo\'s "smart viewing" platform, the V6 box now allows customers to search all services including Netflix for their favourite shows.
"But before we get into any more of the box specifications, let's take a quick look at the special offers Virgin Media is currently offering new customers who sign up for their TV service:"
Get a free 6 month Netflix Subscription with Virgin Media Bundles
12-month contract. \xc2\xa320 activation fee. Excludes the Player Bundle.
Which Virgin TV packages come with Tivo?
Virgin Media are still offering the Tivo 500GB box and it will work in conjunction with the newer box for multiroom setups.
ew customers signing up for any standalone TV package as well as the budget Player Bundle will receive a Tivo 500GB box.
Customers who take any other premade bundle, including the Mix Bundle, Full House Bundle and VIP Bundle will receive the newer Tivo V6 1TB box.
230+ channels + Sky Cinema + Sky Sports (in HD)
ivo 500GB box vs Tivo V6 1TB box
"The 500GB Tivo box is the original Tivo and while it's likely Virgin will continue to phase this box out, as mentioned, it's still provided to standalone TV customers and Player Bundle customers."
his box has three tuners that allow customers to record one program at the same time as watching another. The 500GB hard drive can store up to 250 hours of standard definition viewing or 50 hours in HD.
espite the extra storage however, the V6 1TB box is much smaller and more compact than the older Tivo.
"Virgin Media have clearly addressed the common complaints of the older Tivo box with this upgrade. By improving processor performance by ten times the new box should alleviate one of the biggest criticisms levelled at the older box: that it's slow and sluggish."
"And without doubt to keep pace with Sky's new Sky Q box, the Virgin V6 box is 4K Ultra HD and HDR (High Dynamic Range) ready - giving customers the chance to watch even more realistic images with greater clarity than ever - albeit when that content becomes available."
"The new V6 box's remote also sees an upgrade: it uses radio frequency rather than infrared to communicate with the box which means it no longer needs a straight line of sight."
nd if it does end up a little too tucked away, it also has a call when lost feature too.
side from the standard activation charge for Virgin Media TV of \xc2\xa320, neither Tivo box require any additional costs.
he new V6 box allows customers to record up to six channels at once, while watching a seventh recording, or alternatively record five channels while watching a live program.
, which allows customers to record six programs while watching a live seventh.
But Sky Q 2TB comes with a \xc2\xa3199 setup fee, whereas the default \xc2\xa320 setup box - Sky Q 1TB - only allows customers to record three shows simultaneously while watching a fourth live.
"That's only slightly more than the older Tivo 500GB which allows customers to record up to three channels, while watching a fourth prerecorded program."
"And if six tuners still isn't enough, the new V6 box also offers the ability to bolster the number of simultaneous recordings even further by using a second V6 box with "
While the Tivo 500GB box is HD and 3D content ready, the newer V6 box also offers compatibility with 4K Ultra HD and HDR content.
For 3D viewers Virgin offers 3D movies on their pay to view collection.
"While there isn't a lot of 4K Ultra HD or HDR content available yet, customers who take the V6 box will be ready when it is."
he intelligent recommendation function is where Tivo really differs from Sky.
"Both Sky and Virgin's TV guides offer suggestions based on what we've previously recorded or bookmarked, but Tivo goes one step further."
"We can give as many as three thumbs up to the TV we love (Sherlock) and a maximum of three thumbs down to programmes we can't stand (TOWIE). "
", Tivo should then learn what we like and can work out what else we'll enjoy - and just as importantly, what we really don't want to see, and will suggest and even record the ones it thinks we'll like. "
For example, if we like and record 
, the Tivo box will probably record 
"For those who also have a Netflix subscription, the magic doesn't end there. The Tivo box should search both the channels in our TV subscription and the entire Netflix catalogue to find recommendations from both, and keep them by."
hose of us who keep odd hours, then, or who have been left bereft by the end of yet another Scandi crime drama, will always find something in our "suggestions" folder regardless of what\'s on live TV.
Like Sky Q, it has a wish list feature, based on simple search terms.
"The most obvious example is the title of a show that's vanished from the mainstream channels - say "
s soon as any of the channels in our subscription - even the really obscure ones buried in the depths of the channel list - shows a program matching that search term, the box will flag it and record it. 
lternatively, we can search by actor or director, so Scorsese buffs and Channing Tatum fans alike will never miss out.
Customers with iPhones, iPads and iPod touches, Android mobiles and Android tablets featuring v4.1 or above, can live stream some - but not all - of the channels in their subscription to their mobile devices using the Virgin TV Anywhere app.
"In addition to this, Virgin TV Anywhere allows customers to use their mobiles as remote controls for the Tivo box - so when we're out and a friend reminds us of that new series we fancied watching, no problem!"
"Tivo's intelligent suggestion facility means this shouldn't be as much of an issue as it might otherwise be, but it's a great back-up system."
"If it turns out that our box's storage is running low, we can use the app to delete those old episodes or its less accurate suggestions as well."
"People with Tivo have two ways to access the free-to-air channels' catch up services: through individual apps for BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4 and My 5, or through the TV guide."
With the 500GB Tivo box, there have been complaints about lags and lower quality content when using the apps, and the fact that the apps themselves are difficult to find in a tricky-to-navigate system.
"The alternative is, as mentioned, using the TV guide to scroll back through the past seven days' listings. Any program available through catch up will have a little C symbol next to it: select that program and it'll load up for you."
"There's also the option to plump for additional Tivo boxes, five maximum, via Virgin Media's multiroom service with prices starting at \xc2\xa37.50 extra, per box, per month and an activation cost of \xc2\xa349.95. Although additional activation costs may apply to those taking more than one extra box."
Multiroom viewing allows subscribers to watch content recorded on one box on another and as all boxes have access to the same channels, other people in the house can watch a different show at the same time on a different box.
"more about Virgin's multiroom service in this guide"
Unlike lesser set top boxes, Tivo is capable of recording back-to-back programs without losing the final moments of one or the starting moments of another.
"When we record two programs, one straight after the other, there's a brief period when the recordings overlap - for this brief period we're recording two things at once."
ivo will keep recording each channel using the already assigned tuner, and separate the programs after the fact.
"As mentioned in the comments below, this means that even with the three tuner box it's technically possible to have six recordings going at once - with the end buffers of the earlier programs all recording at the same time as the opening buffers of the subsequent programs."
"When one of the back-to-back recordings is on one more channel than Tivo can handle, it will ask which recording to risk - and if it's going to be a repeated issue we'll be given the chance to reprioritise future recordings."
"If we're not in, we'll need to use TV Anywhere app on our mobile to reschedule one of the recordings, or hope that the box really does know what we like."
One of the main gripes about Tivo is that the interface is not quite as intuitive as it might be.
\r\nWe are always looking at ways to improve our Tivo services and offerings, including regular software updates and the introduction of new content and apps.\r\n
"Most of us want to dive in and start playing with the new box straight away - but this is one toy it's worth taking our time with."
"Read the guide that comes with it, otherwise there's a very good chance of spending ages doing things the slow way and missing out on half of what Tivo can do."
While it seems Virgin have addressed previous complaints about the slow and sluggish performance of the older Tivo box by improving the processor power of the new V6 Tivo box by ten times, we mention it here for anyone concerned about performance.
s you can see in the comments below, we\'ve heard from a number of Virgin customers who\'ve had issues with the speed at which the Tivo 500GB box reacts to commands, from loading menus to simple commands like "play".
"As the apps aren't the easiest to find, this can make loading a program from Netflix or BBC iPlayer more frustrating than we would like."
When we raised the issue with Virgin last year, they said that despite it being frustrating for those it affects, "the numbers complaining of this problem is actually very small." 
"We are always looking at ways to improve our Tivo services and offerings, including regular software updates and the introduction of new content and apps." 
ll we can say to anyone concerned - or currently experiencing the issue - is increased speed has been addressed by Virgin as one of the main selling points of the V6 box.
However, if you have upgraded to or recently taken out a Virgin subscription with a V6 Tivo box do share in the comments how it performs compared to the older box.
"Finally, there is one more very real danger with Tivo: it'll leave you unable to watch linear television ever again."
Got a point of view on Tivo? Let us know in the comments below.
"The world's worst remote control. Great picture quality, but terrible functionality."
"The Tivo 500 is extremely slow due to the numerous firmware updates to resolve issues. Virgin already know this, you only have to pop over to the community forum to see it's the most complained about issue , so to deny it is very counter intuitive - it is also the same problem with Huawei TalkTalk Youview boxes as well."
"I have opened up all of them and repaired many of them as well as imaging the hard drives and analysing the Linux systems they are based on and they are quite reliable until the hard disk starts developing bad sectors especially on track zero - then it's game over and everything is lost."
"The fact of the matter is that both these variants are out of date - slow processors and low memory don't help - they have less memory now than a new smartphone!"
"It also caches and stores thumbs and other system personalisation which I believe becomes fragmented on the drive. It also doesn't help that the Tivo 500 uses the slowest WDC drives, Green 5400rpm ones, instead of the proper Black , Purple 7200rpm drives they should use."
he price of Virgin now is almost as bad as Sky.
Whilst the TalkTalk Youview boxes may be poorer by comparison, if you are looking to save money the equivalent TalkTalk subscription costs half of the Virgin entry "M" level at &pound;22.95 and for some reason it has far more channels on Freeview than the Tivo basic which doesn\'t have Horror Channel, CBS and many others that are available even on your Freeview tuner equipped telly!
he end game is the Tivo functionality and learning smart which beats anything else on the market.
"As the reviewer has said, once you start using a Tivo or TalkTalk or Sky box there isn't any going back!"
"Absolute rubbish, previous box was much better. Clearer screen, more logical. This new one has text that looks as though it been written by a 3 year old. Ridiculous pastel colours, making it difficult to see the important stand out options. A wishy washy dolly mixture mess. Slow. Don't subscribe. I just want the old TiVo back, but unable to do so. If it wasn't for the spectacularly ugly Sky dish I would opt for that! Thank goodness for Kodi..."
"No 'back' button to undo whatever inappropriate selection you just made because the box just caught up, or to return to the previous channel. You cannot just set a program to turn over . The menus are far too complex and laggy. The upgrade path does not allow preservation of recordings from old V+ box."
Our TiVo box is a disaster. We had an old V+ box that worked very well, then we had a letter from Virgin saying that unless we upgraded to a TiVo box by April 2017 then we may find our service would stop working. ... so we got the TiVo box. Biggest mistake ever.
"It's slow, even for the most basic functions. A lot slower than our old V+ box. "
"For most of the past month we haven't been able to get Channel 4 catch-up. Countrywide problem with TiVo apparently!  There are glitchy problems with it that are intermittent so we haven't been able to persuade Virgin to replace it. We are constantly resetting it!   "
"Had Sky for 8 years. Very few problems but broadband speed was pretty awful at times. Deserted them and had Virgin installed. Big mistake. Broadband speed great. TiVo box absolute rubbish. Compared to Sky+ box it's in the dark ages. Far too much clutter in it. Far too slow. Simple things like deleting a programme. Press delete and it then asks if you want to delete this programme. Think that's why I pressed delete in the first place! Numerous other examples."
Yesterday I lost the signal for the whole day. No broadband or TV. 
Unfortunately I am on an 18 month contract but will be ditching it at the first opportunity.
Lots of problems, e.g. slow and locking up.
"V+ was miles quicker - do a search for 'slow Tivo', even on the virginmedia community site there are loads of comments on this. Go with another provider or get Freeview/Freesat or just get Virgin Broadband, nothing wrong with that."
"We've had a Tivo for a few years now and I wouldn't be without it. The machine records series for us and upcoming films, etc. Even the recommendations it records for us are reasonable. So that side is great."
"On the downside.. over the years it's got slower and slower and the UI has become more and more complex. It can take a long time to switch between functions, it can take ages to navigate through the menus. It's a pain. It's lag-city."
"The box is clearly under-powered for what it's being asked to do. When we first had the Tivo I didn't feel this way, so I think it's just been over-developed for the hardware. The underlying technology is pretty old now, I would think."
"We have an Apple TV too. It doesn't do the same things as the Tivo, but every time I use it, it's snappy - delay free and a joy to use. Often it makes me think how good it is compared to the Tiko."
iko needs an overhaul and I think Virgin will probably release a new box at some stage that supports 4K.
"Would I suggest people have a Tiko? I would - but prepare for the slowness and spend a little time getting to know the interface. It's not that hard, even if the lag is frustrating."
readful - leave well alone. Never really worked out how to use it and Virgin never seemed keen to explain
"Absolutely awful. It was bad when it came out and now it is actually even worse thanks to the terrible and bloated updates. VM will not hear a bad word about it, so no chance of getting a good box like Sky, BT or TalkTalk offer any time soon. Don't do it, if I had an easy phone line option away from VM, I would jump ship in a heartbeat."
"Virgin's Tivo is a clunky slow trainwreck. Support for third party apps like BBC iPlayer is unusable. On an internet connected device, why can't it tell if a sports programme is delayed / extended? No 4K. Regularly fails to record upcoming shows. Slow - slow - slow, nasty unresponsive 90s tech still being flogged in 2016.."
"We've had Virgin in the past, then went to Sky and got on fine with both the V+ and Sky+ boxes. We moved back to Virgin for better internet and thought the box would be an upgrade of V+.... but Tivo is useless. I find myself watching things on demand by running iPlayer and the like off my laptop and using my tv as a monitor, rather than dealing with Tivos awkward and slow menus."
We have the upgraded Tivo and I agree with Chris - it\'s a trainwreck. The delay in bringing up the news is astonishingly slow. I definitely prefer Sky even if it isn\'t so "intelligent" - at least it doesn\'t suffer from a self deluded belief that it can do things that it then struggles to complete.
he Tivo box is soo pants compared to Sky.
"It's fine once you are watching what you want, but going in and out of the menu's is a mess and really really slow. They need to fix this, especially with Sky launching their new box."
"I just quite simply don't understand how to use it!!!!! I wish that I could cancel but I can't (which isn't what the Virgin salesman told me when he called to persuade me to upgrade my package from broadband only - a broad-faced lie!); When I try to stream a film it continually buffers so I've given up doing that.. the rest of viewing I get on freeview anyway. Stay away from Virgin"
"TiVo is a million times better than SKY+, granted some people have issues (this will always happen with mass use of technology) .  Do you think every sky customer is happy with the performance of their box..of course not!  options are convoluted, agreed.  However every step of the way you have options where as with sky it's do or don't.   Sky have had over 20 years to finesse their user interface whereas TiVo has been in the UK for 5/6 years only.  it's like trying to compare an old analogue (brick) phone to the latest smartphone.  TiVo can do soo much more therefore it's bound to be more complicated until you get used it.  I've had it for 2 years now and still find new stuff it can do.  I agree with those that say it has a speed lapse but remember it has a platform that has to be compatible with different companies products ranging from apps/games, On demand, catch up players and also Windows and Apple platforms.  Most of the issues mentioned below sound like faults that people are putting up with rather than getting fixed (if you don't do anything about it, stop complaining about it).  Oh and Virgin Media don't charge for call outs or replacing equipment whether you are in a contract or not!  If you're not in a contract with sky and don't pay them a monthly amount (rip-off alert) they will ask you for your hard earned money to fix THEIR service and products!  "
For the lady that mentioned the popping sound annoying her...you can switch it off love, that option is there for people with vision impairments.
"I absolutely agree with JB. I have been using a 500Gb Tivo box for about 4 years now and I wouldn't be without it. I've tried BT's offering, and that truly was pants! I have also used Sky and of the 3 of those services that I have personal experience of, Tivo is by far the most superior."
Just got a Tivo box yesterday { its middle of the night now } and in the middle of a film it goes off and the words "Starting Up" appear on screen. Then it kept going back to the start of a 5 minute countdown and flashing The words "Starting Up" again and again. So not even a day or night of use out of this piece of junk and I want to bin it already. Virgin Media can have it back now I know why they were paying me to take it hmmm!!!!! Yep, my bill went down in cost so long as I took this joke of a box and the new Modem for my internet.
ll of the below - plus! Unbelievably slow, totally unintuitive - insult added to injury by that b----y popping noise. It drives me demented. Whose idiotic idea is that?
I would join Virgin media, only if i could get a V+ box and not a tivo. Seen them working in friends houses, I have seen first hand how bad they are, would avoid like the plague.
It\'s a train wreck - steer clear. I am on the verge of cancelling my subscription due to all of the problems listed below by others. The box is slow, unreliable, unresponsive, frustrating... the "intelligence" in program recording is a joke - the box insists on recording programs I have zero interest and have consistently "thumbs downed"... I\'m starting to think the thing is possessed. Maybe I should try an exorcism.
"I don't have any of the above problems so must be a setting problem in settings."
he review mentions about back-to-back recordings not meaning 3 programs at once, but actually 2. This isn\'t quite right - if back-to-back recordings are scheduled, TiVo will realise this and use the same tuner to record them, stitching them together within its "brain". So actually you could feasibly record 6 programs at once in this scenario. All while watching something else either recorded or via iPlayer streaming if you fancy - or you could record two channels back-to-back and use the third tuner for live-TV.
"Thanks for your comment - that's really useful to know. We've updated the article to incorporate your points."
"The original TiVo was great but unfortunately Virgin's implementation of it has just gone from bad to worse and almost unusable. Just search for slow Virgin TiVo on Google."
"It's just OK for just watching live TV and recorded stuff, but the menus are slow, accessing catch up is bad, and the apps like Netflix and youtube are unusable, painfully slow and unreliable."
"If you want to watch catch up services or use Netflix then any  smart TV tablet or PC will do it much much better, don't bother with the TiVo it's just painful."
Virgin are in complete denial about the state of their TiVo service, it needs new updated hardware and/or a complete rewrite to improve performance.
"Meanwhile they just tell you to reboot it constantly as a short term 'fix'."
We ordered a Tivo to replace the older Virgin box. We are tempted by the significant monthly savings. Unfortunately the response times when pressing buttons are unsettling. Most of using iPlayer via the app was painfully slow and it kept pausing to catch up during playback of catch up TV. All very annoying and we had to send it back as unfit for purpose.  The downside being we also had to go back to the old higher tariff. Shame they have made a pigs ear of what was a great reliable catch up service on iPlayer.
"Don't have any of the above problems."
More complicated than Sky even watching a film on demand if you pause it longer than 10 mins it goes off and you have to start the film again or fast it forward again and who ever designed the remote needs a slap.
ivo UI is like pulling teeth but more painful. They must have worked so hard to make it as slow as it is. Every button press results in a 3 to 5 second delay minimum before it responds. I gave up on the catch up. Ridiculously convoluted to use. The Netflix feature you mentioned has never occurred for me.
"Great isn't it? Except it isn't. Compared to the Sky+ box the Tivo is ridiculously convoluted, you need to press 10 buttons where one will do on the Sky box and you can't record catchup TV to watch at a later date. It's perhaps the MOST unintuitive object I have ever had the misfortune to try and use!"
