iVo Roamio OTA review: It feels like going back in time
iVo Bolt review: The best DVR gets better
s time goes by,\xc2\xa0 TiVo gets harder to love.\xc2\xa0The cable-box DVRs for which TiVo serves as an alternative are becoming more sophisticated, with modern interfaces, voice search, and built-in streaming apps. Forgoing cable entirely is also getting easier, thanks to a proliferation of streaming services and new over-the-air DVR solutions. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s consumer hardware business is getting squeezed from both directions.
he TiVo Bolt Vox is an attempt to push back. Like the existing TiVo Bolt, the Vox serves as either a DVR for cable subscribers or a way to record free over-the-air channels from an antenna. Its main addition is a new remote with voice search, and it also ships with a long-awaited software overhaul. (Existing TiVo Bolt and Roamio owners can upgrade to the new software for free, and buy the voice remote for $45.)
But while TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s recording capabilities are still second-to-none, and its integration with streaming services is still a clever idea, the Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s additions only paper over deficiencies in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app platform and hardware. Despite the new software and voice search, using a TiVo Bolt Vox still feels like stepping back into a bygone era.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has the same design as the old Bolt, with a rectangular enclosure that arches updward on one side. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a coaxial input, HDMI output, optical audio output, 3.5mm audio jack, e-SATA storage port, and two USB ports. (The USB ports don\xe2\x80\x99t support external DVR storage, and the only e-SATA drive that works with TiVo sells at a huge markup.) A hatch underneath the Bolt Vox houses a CableCARD slot.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has every conceivable port you might need.
iVo is selling three versions of the Bolt Vox. The 500GB model and 1TB models both have four tuners and cost $200 and $300 respectively. The 3TB model has 6 tuners for $500, but it only works with cable, not over-the-air broadcasts.
In all cases, TiVo charges $15 per month or $150 per year for DVR service. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lifetime service option for $550, which is on top of the cost of hardware.
If you want to use TiVo as a whole-home DVR, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Mini or Mini Vox satellite units, which costs $150 and $180 respectively. The latter comes with the same voice remote as the Bolt Vox, and it supports 4K video. The Tivo Bolt Vox can stream live and recorded TV to iOS and Android devices at no extra charge. (There\xe2\x80\x99s also a beta app for Fire TV devices, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been updated in two years and only works with recorded programs.)
One thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice with the TiVo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x94at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting out in the open\xe2\x80\x94is that it\xe2\x80\x99s constantly whirring. Noise emanates from the unit whether it\xe2\x80\x99s recording or not, whether the TV is on or off, and strangely even when the TiVo itself is on standby. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a major nuisance, especially from 10 feet away, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of how unobtrusive fanless streaming boxes and sticks are by comparison.
One might say the same of the TiVo Bolt Vox remote, which remains a hefty tool loaded with buttons, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99ll seldom press. The main differences from the regular Bolt remote are the new voice search button (more on that later), a Netflix button, and a dedicated button for TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s existing ad-skipping feature. Cable subscribers will likely feel at home with the setup; but again, those who\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to streaming players like Roku and Apple TV may recoil at the remote\xe2\x80\x99s chunkiness.
he Tivo Bolt Vox remote borrows more from cable boxes than modern streaming devices.
he Tivo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s biggest new feature is its software, previously codenamed \xe2\x80\x9cHydra\xe2\x80\x9d and now just known as the New User Interface. It\xe2\x80\x99s pre-loaded on the Bolt Vox, but existing TiVo owners have the option to upgrade as well.
iVo has given its UI some much-needed streamlining.
he new software strikes a more modern look, trading rounded rectangles and color gradients for sharp edges and solid colors. It\xe2\x80\x99s also more visual, often letting you scroll through thumbnail images instead of plain text.
More importantly, it provides a much-needed streamlining to the menu system. The main menu now has three content sections\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Shows\xe2\x80\x9d for recordings, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d for recommendations, and a launcher for third-party apps\xe2\x80\x94plus a search function and a settings menu. The What to Watch menu is especially useful, creating a unified TV guide out of various channels and streaming services. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a strip of quick recommendations at the bottom of the screen, based on what TiVo thinks you might like.
he \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d menu pulls upcoming programs, recordings, and streaming video into one handy guide.
Voice commands are helpful too, letting you jump around the menu system and search for titles, actors, and directors. The remote seldom failed to understand me, and search supports complex queries like \xe2\x80\x9c80\xe2\x80\x99s comedies\xe2\x80\x9d and follow-up questions like \xe2\x80\x9cJust the ones with Rick Moranis.\xe2\x80\x9d You can even filter the results to only show content from Netflix, Amazon, or Vudu. The only downsides are that search doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with all streaming services\xe2\x80\x94HBO Go is a major omission\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t search from inside a third-party app.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search is accurate, and understands complex queries.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s software still has some rough patches. Transitions and animations tend to be choppy compared to modern streaming boxes, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon menu concept\xe2\x80\x94in which rows of image thumbnails appear as you scroll through a column of menu text\xe2\x80\x94can be disorienting compared to fully image-driven apps like Netflix. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no apparent way to browse shows by genre while filtering out results from streaming services. And most annoyingly of all, TiVo always reverts to playing live TV when it\xe2\x80\x99s left alone in a menu for too long. It really ought to revert to standby mode instead.
Beyond those gripes, I imagine some TiVo enthusiasts will be dissatisfied with design changes in general, and with some particular things like the replacement of the 
It\xe2\x80\x99s all the more tragic, then, that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s streaming app support is still lacking.
lthough TiVo offers most of the basic streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any streaming channel bundles, which cord-cutters might want to supplement over-the-air channels. The platform has MLB T V, but not NBA League Pass or NHL TV. CBS News lacks the live anchored coverage that\xe2\x80\x99s offered on other platforms, and neat new streaming apps like Pluto TV and Hoopla are also absent. Aside from HBO Go, pretty much every TV Everywhere app is missing from TiVO as well. A fresh coat of paint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app catalog is stagnant.
You know an app platform has problems when Flixfling and Ameba are near the top of the list.
he TiVo Bolt Vot is still a great DVR at its core. It allows users to get granular with their recording preferences, for instance by keeping only a certain number of recent episodes, avoiding recordings in standard definition, and customizing start and stop buffer times. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to weed out scheduling conflicts through a dedicated menu, and with four tuners in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s base models, conflicts should be rare to begin with. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s OnePass feature, which lets you view recorded and streaming episodes of a show from a single view, remains a nice touch as well.
But without a vibrant app scene, the TiVo Bolt Vox still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as an all-in-one entertainment box for the streaming age. Cord-cutters in search of consolidation should instead look to 
a decent option for a single television
, provided you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind switching inputs when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stream.
he TiVo Bolt Vox will mainly appeal to diehard cable subscribers who might not mind the investment in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s hardware and services. But as more people give up cable TV in favor of antenna channels and streaming services, the squeeze on TiVo seems unlikely to let up.

Just in case you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living on a desert island for the last two years, allow us to catch you up: Voice interfaces are the latest tech trend and they\xe2\x80\x99re showing up everywhere, from smartphones to smart speakers. As of Tuesday, even your favorite DVR is getting in on the voice action: 
\xc2\xa0is adding two new products to its 
, with the Bolt Vox, and Mini Vox, confirming earlier rumors.
Both devices come with TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s new\xc2\xa0Vox remote, with a nearly identical layout to previous Bolt remotes except for two notable additions, including a prominent light-blue microphone button, and \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time on a TiVo remote \xe2\x80\x94 a dedicated Netflix button.
he TiVo Bolt Vox, with up to 4K Ultra HD resolution, which includes four integrated tuners starts at $200 for the 500 GB model. You can also choose a larger 1TB model for $299, or go for the gusto with the top of the line 3TB model at $499.
he TiVo Mini Vox, which is a companion to the Bolt Vox, letting you access content at up to 4K Ultra HD resolution on other TVs in your home, is $180.
You can also buy the Vox remote (available in black or white) on its own for $40. It can be used with existing Bolt boxes as-is, or with TiVo Mini and 
set-top boxes \xe2\x80\x94 but these require an additional Bluetooth module, bumping the price to $45.
iVo has clearly done its homework on the Vox voice commands: The company incorporates the best features of 
\xe2\x80\x9cShow me movies with Tom Cruise,\xe2\x80\x9d then refine the query by saying things like, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the comedies\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe one where he says, \xe2\x80\x98Show me the money.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d
he voice commands also work with playback control, with commands like \xe2\x80\x9cSkip it,\xe2\x80\x9d which will automatically jump you past the ads on a recorded program. Speaking of skipping, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find three new buttons on the Vox remote: A skip button (previously you had to use the \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button to skip ads), a Netflix quick key \xe2\x80\x94 another Roku-inspired move \xe2\x80\x94 and of course the microphone button, which you need to press to initiate a voice command.
Bolt Vox and Mini Vox users will also benefit from TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s latest user experience update, which makes it easier to see what\xe2\x80\x99s streaming on each TiVo box in your home, while also improving some of the personalization features.

iVo\xe2\x80\x99s new Bolt Vox DVR has voice search built into the remote
he voice remote is available separately for recent TiVo boxes
iVo announced three new products this morning including two set-top boxes, the Bolt Vox and Mini Vox, plus a remote control with voice search capabilities for existing, recent TiVo hardware. Alongside these new devices, TiVo is showcasing the updated software that runs on them, which will also come to Bolt and Roamio DVRs later this fall.
If you know your TV gadgets, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that several popular streaming devices like Roku, Fire TV, and Apple TV already support universal voice search \xe2\x80\x94 each in their own way \xe2\x80\x94 that brings together content from many different services. Comcast and Dish are also making a big push in voice because it helps conceal the fragmented reality of entertainment in 2017; we all like watching shows on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu... and yes, cable too. So tying all of that content together isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new endeavor. But TiVo is positioning these new Vox devices as the most comprehensive and easiest solution of everything out there. That \xe2\x80\x9cunified entertainment system\xe2\x80\x9d was the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s big selling point in 2015. 
Walt Mossberg was rather happy with it
. Now, the company hopes that layering voice search and revamped software onto the convenience of never changing HDMI inputs will be enough.
he Bolt Vox looks extremely similar in design to the Bolt released two years ago, but this time there\xe2\x80\x99s no white version. It only comes in black. The connections around back are all identical, as well. In fact, there appear to be no hardware differences at all between the Bolt Vox and original Bolt from 2015. This is the same box as before, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s been rebranded and comes with a bundled voice remote. 
torage options are also unchanged. The base 500GB Bolt Vox DVR costs $199.99 and includes four tuners. A higher capacity 1TB ($299) model is available, but the most spacious 3TB 6-tuner version ($499) is again only compatible with digital cable inputs and not over-the-air antenna programming. So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at an extremely iterative hardware revision here. For the main DVR, anyway.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s new $179.99 Mini Vox is an upgraded, more powerful version of the TiVo Mini, which is a smaller box that plugs into secondary TVs around your house to give them access to your recordings, live TV, and a few key streaming apps. The Mini Vox now supports 4K playback (the prior Mini was limited to 1080p), and it too also has the new voice remote control right in the box. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll still need a MoCA (multimedia over coax) hookup or ethernet-based home network if you want to assemble this multi-room TiVo system. Wi-Fi alone won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.
s always, once you\xe2\x80\x99ve purchased TiVo hardware, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay separately for one of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service plans. The monthly subscription is $14.99, with annual ($149.99) and \xe2\x80\x9call-in\xe2\x80\x9d options also available. The $549.99 all-in plan covers TiVo service for the life of your device. That business model probably sounds absurd to people who\xe2\x80\x99ve never owned or really used a TiVo, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what gets you the signature, convenient features like flawless commercial skipping (for supported shows) and so on.
iVo calls the software that ships on Bolt Vox its \xe2\x80\x9cnext-gen experience,\xe2\x80\x9d and it does seem like a significant improvement when you remember that this is the company that took years to fully convert its menus to HD. There are carousels of nice TV show/movie artwork, and TiVo is very good about making it very clear 
he navigation for some of these sections seems a bit confusing to me at first glance, but I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s more intuitive in practice after a few minutes. It definitely looks much nicer, and TiVo has taken care to keep your current show in view whenever you\xe2\x80\x99re messing around in the menus so you don\xe2\x80\x99t miss anything if you want to survey what else is on. 
s for the big new thing \xe2\x80\x94 voice search \xe2\x80\x94 TiVo says you can ask for shows or movies and fine tune results as they came back. So you can say \xe2\x80\x9cShow me movies with Tom Hanks\xe2\x80\x9d and then add \xe2\x80\x9conly the dramas\xe2\x80\x9d to whittle the list. Voice commands also work for TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s software tricks like SkipMode and QuickMode, which speeds up the program you\xe2\x80\x99re watching by 30 percent. 
But nothing about TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search powers seems all that unique or novel compared to the competition. Streaming boxes can already help filter search results in a similar manner, and both Roku and Amazon are extending a hand to cord-cutters with deeper integration of live OTA TV, so you can just say \xe2\x80\x9cturn on NBC\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99ll work on TVs with that software built in. I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling to see the must-have thing here when Alexa can now control Fire TV and Google Home can launch videos on your Chromecast. Those seem like more compelling voice interactions. 
If you want TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search (and the new software to go along with it), you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get the Vox voice remote for $39.99 in black or white for Bolt devices. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Roamio (Pro, Plus, or OTA), the remote costs slightly more at $44.99 since it includes a Bluetooth adapter. Everything goes on sale October 29th at Amazon, Best Buy, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s web store, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending more time with the Bolt Vox soon.

"TiVo's back and it's got a new kickass remote control with voice controls"
he new TiVo Volt with voice remote control.
2017-10-24
12:03:40
"To prove it's still got some fight in it, the company's releasing a new version of its DVR, the Bolt Vox, with a remote control that supports voice controls."
Why the iPhone 8 Plus is a better camera than a real camera
he new Bolt Vox looks identical to the previous 
, complete with the same quirky, bent design on its all-black exterior.
"Inside's the same, too. It comes with four tuners and the same three storage models: 500GB ($200), 1TB ($300), and 3TB ($500). A TiVo Service plan is also still required and works out to $15 per month (with a 1-year contract), $150 every year, or $550 per year for the all-service plan."
"The box itself is nothing special. It's the smarter software and new pack-in remote with voice controls that finally bring TiVo into the modern era."
"If you've ever used a Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote or an Apple TV with Siri Remote, you'll be right at home with the TiVo remote's voice commands."
Unlike Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, the proprietary TiVo voice controls are designed to help you find and launch content quickly, not tell you the weather, or trivia stats, or control your smart home.
Press and hold the voice search button and say something like "Show me action movies" and the Vox will display all that are available. But a good voice search understands context. If you follow up the first request with "only movies with Clint Eastwood" and then maybe "only westerns," the Vox will understand the context in relation to action movies.
I tried this out on a pre-production Vox and it worked. Vox\'s voice remote also knows how to find movies with two actors and actresses (i.e. "Show me movies with George Clooney and Julia Roberts") and when sports games are playing ("When do the Jets play?").
You can also jump to a TV channel by saying its channel name or the number (if you still remember them) and can launch internet video streaming apps like Netflix, HBO Go, or Amazon Videos, which are built-in.
By far the best thing about the voice search is looking up a movie by a quote. Yes, really. For example, when I said "Say hello to my little friend" into the remote control, the Vox instantly recognized that as a quote from Tony Montana and displayed the option to watch 
"It was pretty neat. At launch, there are only about 100-150 movie quotes supported (and who knows which ones those are), but TiVo says it's looking to add more. Right now, the quotes are manually programmed into its software, but the company's exploring the possibility of crowdsourcing the quotes in order to include more."
"The other big addition to the Vox is its smarter predictive software. Whereas TiVo's known for its usually spot-on recommendation engine, the company's now turning into AI to better suggest content."
o you\'ll a new "Smart Bar" on the interface that starts to predict what you watch in more nuanced ways. Like if you watch a lot of cartoons every day at 5 p.m., it\'ll suggest cartoons during that time, but not during the mornings when you watch news.\xc2\xa0
More personalized and intelligent software is a necessity when you look at video services like Netflix and Amazon and how they get you to binge watch more videos than you really have time for.
"I'm not a TiVo owner myself (I've switched to YouTube TV and its unlimited cloud DVR), but there are millions of customers who still are. For them, voice controls will finally help take out the complexities of discovering content.\xc2\xa0"
"Which is why the company's not only blessing Vox owners with the remote, but existing Bolt and Roamio DVR owners will be able to purchase voice remote controls for their boxes. Bolt owners will need to pay $40 for the voice remote and Roamio owners will pay $45. Customers with Roamio DVRs will need a Bluetooth USB receiver dongle, though."
"It's easy to dismiss TiVo in the age of "
", both of which offer cloud DVR, but none are as robust and feature-packed. The price for the box and service isn't cheap, but if you really, really love watching TV, a TiVo's still a great companion."
"WATCH: Google's Pixel 2 and 2 XL are perfect if you don't want to spend $1,000 on a new phone"

iVo Adds Voice Search on New Vox Boxes
he new TiVo Bolt Vox and Mini Vox let users search for content with voice commands thanks to a microphone-equipped remote.
iVo is joining the growing legion of 
"The company's new Vox line of products are upgraded versions of the TiVo Bolt and "
he Bolt Vox retains the same unique curved-top design as the original 
", while the Mini Vox sports a more minimalist, flat-sided look similar to the Apple TV. Internally, they're effectively the same hardware as their predecessors, with the same 1080p recording and playback capabilities."
"The real change is with the new Vox Remote TiVo included with the Vox boxes. It's a thick, curved dog bone of a remote control with conventional rubber buttons, just like the previous TiVo Bolt remote. Now it has a built-in microphone, similar to the mics on the remotes of the "
. The microphone enables voice search, a sophisticated TiVo-built engine that can find movies and shows based on a variety of characteristics. You can look up content by title, actor, and genre, or you can ask using more esoteric search criteria, like awards and famous quotes.
he TiVo Vox also supports a limited selection of TiVo-specific voice commands. You can set up season recordings and add shows to your TiVo OnePass by saying "Create a OnePass for this show," or skip past commercials by saying "Skip it." The voice system is very TiVo-specific, and doesn\'t incorporate any voice assistant like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri to control smart devices or answer general questions; it\'s strictly for using your TiVo.
"The Bolt Vox and Mini Vox will get a few interface enhancements in addition to voice search. The new boxes will support QuickView, providing live feeds of multiple tuners at the same time. The new SmartBar will provide even more suggestions for what to watch out of what is currently on, based on your viewing habits. Considering how impressive TiVo's prediction engine has been in the past, adding consideration for the time could make finding what to watch even more convenient."
he TiVo Bolt Vox and Mini Vox will both be in stores Oct. 29. The Bolt Vox will start at $199.99 for the 500GB model, with a 1TB version also available. The Mini Vox will retail for $179.99. The Bolt Vox requires a TiVo service subscription, and the Mini Vox requires a primary DVR system like the Bolt Vox to extend the service to additional TVs.
If you have a regular TiVo Bolt, TiVo Mini, or TiVo Roamio, you can add the voice search feature by purchasing the Vox Remote on its own for $39.99 (for the Bolt or second-generation Mini) or $44.99 (for the

I use for OTA connection. the TV viewing works fine and the channel scan was very quick. I gave it 2 stars because of the streaming performance. Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon prime all play ok for a short time, 30 to 45 minutes and then start to stutter. The LG TV that the Tivo plugs into streams with the same network cable just fine. My Roamio OTA streams just fine also. I tried both wired network and wireless network, and they behaved the same way. I have 100mb download speed.. I also had a strange HDMI glitch of losing signal to the TV while streaming. I had to unplug both ends of the HDMI cable (purchased new) and it works fine now. The computer that was plugged into that HDMI port never had any issues for over 2 years. Once the streaming apps are fixed this should be an excellent unit.

iVo\xe2\x80\x99s new TiVo BOLT VOX DVR offers consumers 4 tuners to record up to 4 shows at once, and either 500GB or 1TB of integrated storage as well as connectivity for cable or over-the-air antennas. In addition, TiVo is making a six-tuner version with 3TB of storage for cable users.
iVo also revamped its multi-room companion box capable of streaming programming from a TiVo DVR in the same home, which is now called the TiVo VOX Mini. The 4K-capable Mini, which also offers access to streaming apps, costs $180, and the 4-tuner version of the\xc2\xa0TiVo BOLT VOX starts at $200. The latter requires a TiVo subscription, whereas the Mini doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need an additional subscription plan. All of the hardware will become available this coming Sunday.

iVo also tweaked the user interface of its DVR for this new generation, promising quicker access to live and recorded TV, and better recommendations. But the biggest news is undoubtedly the remote the two new devices ship with \xe2\x80\x94 or more specifically, the remote\xe2\x80\x99s microphone button.
Pressing it, users can now ask the device to launch a TV channel, ask for movies or shows starring a certain actor, skip commercials or command the device to record an upcoming show. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice interface even understands follow-up queries, so you can ask for movies starring an actor, and then filter down to a genre.
o build this functionality, TiVo licensed the speech recognition engine from a third party, and developed its own natural language understanding technologies in-house. And the company clearly believes that consumers want voice control: TiVo is also making the technology available to previous-generation devices, which can be upgraded with the purchase of a $39.99 voice control.
But TiVo may even go further in the future. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking at far-field voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malone. This could allow TiVo to unlock additional voice features, he argued. For instance, no one would pick up the current remote, press the mic button and tell the device to lower the volume.
However, the same voice command would make a lot more sense if consumers could control their TiVo with an Amazon Echo or a similar device already standing in their living room. Malone didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to reveal too much about his company\xe2\x80\x99s plans to enable such functionality, but did mention TiVo didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tie itself to just once voice assistant. He also hinted at plans to show off third-party voice integrations at CES 2018.
iVo has been playing a bit of a tech catch-up game in recent years, and gradually added features like streaming apps and now voice that have been available on\xc2\xa0 devices like Apple TV and Roku for some time.
However, the company has also been producing hardware for pay TV operators, and some of those features are arguably still very new to that market \xe2\x80\x94 which is why TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s retail hardware doubles as a kind of R&D for its pay TV business. \xe2\x80\x9cWe use the retail business as a way to try out new things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malone.

iVo Bolt Vox Review: A DVR With 4K Visuals & Voice Commands
Voice commands are quickly becoming a standard feature within the home entertainment experience, with companies like Samsung, 
Meet TiVo BOLT VOX, the voice-powered ultimate entertainment system. 
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s 4K Bolt Vox and its smaller counterpart, the TiVo Mini Vox, will continue to blend the usefulness of internet-esque services with the comfort of using a television. In\xc2\xa0CNET\xe2\x80\x99s report, the forthcoming Bolts even share their internal components with the previous renditions of the Bolt. The inclusion of voice controls is unquestionably the biggest addition to the DVR, giving users a user-friendly way to change the channel or order commands.
he Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s user interface has been redesigned, following the grid templet set by others. However, one nifty contribution is the new QuickView tool. This lets you see other content without needing to stop the program you\xe2\x80\x99re currently enjoying.
ymbolizing the genesis of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s new DVR is the presence of an improved remote. The button positioning has been tweaked, generally making for a more organized layout. Furthermore, three new buttons have been added; a big blue button sits near the top of the device, which controls the voice command feature, whereas a new button dedicated to Netflix sits right under the equator. The final button is the aptly named Skip button.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s new family members will arrive on November 8. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s standard Bolt Vox will cost $199.99. That consists of 500GB, supplying up to 75 hours worth of space. A 1TB model spanning 150 hours will also be available for $299.99, whilst a 3TB unit will last 450 hours. The latter will cost $499.99, but it can only record from digital cable. Moreover, those with the previous Bolt or Bolt+, or the\xc2\xa0TiVo Roamio OTA, Pro or Plus, can also score the voice feature via an interface patch. It will require a purchase of a new remote, however.
Introducing the all-new TiVo BOLT VOX, Mini VOX, and VOX Remote, available October 29. Ready to

On Sunday morning, you will be able to go to a page on the\xc2\xa0TiVo\xc2\xa0website and request the upgrade for any TSN that is on your account. While not technically \xe2\x80\x9cforever\xe2\x80\x9d, you will need to wait 2-3 hours before forcing a call to download the new software.
However, before you take the plunge, there are some things you should know\xe2\x80\xa6
espite the extensive gestation period, including the incorporation of Fan TV talent and\xc2\xa0

\xc2\xa0to Hydra boxes works (via TiVo.com, versus STB initiation) as does\xc2\xa0
) while TiVo pushed their supposedly superior solution and 
Owners of first generation TiVo Minis should be aware they lack the interface\xe2\x80\x99s critical \xe2\x80\x98back\xe2\x80\x99 remote control button. The \xe2\x80\x98zoom\xe2\x80\x99 button will act as a stand-in should you be prepared to move forward with Hydra without committing to the purchase of a new remote.
hould you update to Hydra and later change your mind (or someone in your household changes it for you), you can revert back. However, it requires a complete factory reset \xe2\x80\xa6 and lose of all your recordings.
In any event, I expect several updates over the next few weeks ironing out any last-minute bugs before the team gets to work on more significant refinement based on our feedback and what I assume is an extensive roadmap.

If you\xe2\x80\x99re running 20.7.4 and pick up a TiVo Vox voice remote, clicking the blue voice button will also initiate the Hydra update. 
ed shipped me a 4K Mini Vox that should arrive Monday, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how quickly I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to blogging. Between the day job, new home, and toddler, I have limited time and energy. :) Best bet for more timely updates is to 
Been testing it for weeks. Still *very* buggy but that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from going ahead with it. Other testers are dumbfounded that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to release it so soon. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend waiting a month or two before anyone installs it.
he consumer electronics space has many challenging elements \xe2\x80\x93 and one is you gotta get hardware out for holiday sales, Best Buy shelf reset, along with the new packaging, etc. All this stuff is coordinated months ahead of time. Which means sometimes incomplete software tags along. 
his isn\xe2\x80\x99t specific to TiVo. Although their track record hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been inspiring. For Premiere, they chose to hold back hardware because the HDUI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready, skipped the critical holiday sales season, and still released a beta, incomplete, optional HDUI when they launched hardware the next spring. And that was a very costly delay and decision in my estimation. 
I\xe2\x80\x99m good with, support the recommendation to hang back \xe2\x80\x94 if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so gung ho to test the voice functionality, I\xe2\x80\x99d be waiting too. Hopefully my wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me.
PC to TiVo transfers aren\xe2\x80\x99t operational, but are TiVo to PC transfers operational? I\xe2\x80\x99ve succumb to the practice of transferring to my PC and loading shows into PLEX.
Yes, you can offload recordings under Hydra. The scenario I presented is something of corner case in my opinion, but an associate felt strongly it should be shared.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the two column love guide.  That\xe2\x80\x99s all I use.
Forcing a complete box reset on downgrade is just stupid, recordings should NEVER be trashed.  I get that metadata might be different but the actual streams written to disk should be usable no matter what.
\nYeah I wonder about that. Is it a choice intended to dissuade downgrades or was just easier to program/accommodate given probably more pressing development priorities? I have my suspicions. Hm.
Well I was planning on forcing the connection on Sunday but hearing about all bugs and issues I am having second thoughts.  I am bit shocked that there are still so many bugs especially since this thing have been in development for years and Demo from Feb looked pretty good.  I know those things can be pre-recorded for ultimate results but still.  One thing when it comes to software development bad cost cutting/restructuring (that TiVo went through with merger/acquisition) QA always goes first or becomes the cost saving place.  Then companies have to pay for it with Buggy Software.  Ok enough with ranting, I am excited for Hydra and hoping that Software Updates don\xe2\x80\x99t take 10 years like they did with previous UI.
I believe it is to keep people from downgrading, as the file formats used and the metadata should not change.   It may be because of some sort of file system change or something else, but seems odd.   Does the upgrade require a certain amount of space free on the TiVo rider to upgrade, or can it do so with a nearly 100% full drive?
I still plan on upgrasding one of my Boltd to test Hydra out. But it will not be mu primary TiVo. Ill try it out first before I decide to upgrade my other Bolts, Roamio, and Mini.
I do have a voice remote comiing from Amazon. Which should hopefully show up on Tuesday.
hanks for describing the shortcomings of the new interface, because it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a reason that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be delaying the upgrade as long as possible.
I also much prefer the live guide to any grid guides.  I have used grids before, and while they are more common, they don\xe2\x80\x99t given enough data for a given channel (but much more info for a given time slot).  The live guide is what set Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s Guide experience apart from other DVRs, and it seems backwards to me that they drop that and keep only the grid.  I understand keeping the grid for the cable operators, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t get dropping the live guide option.
Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using the live guide for what seems like forever. The grid guide only seems useful if you are watching live tv with channels grouped together. But I only watch recordings. And when I check the guide, I want to see what is on many hours ahead. Not 1.5 to 2 hours ahead, like the grid guide only shows.
Big thanks to TiVo for making this change optional.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll just relax and enjoy my TV while the rest of you stress out over this.  I may take the plunge in a few months if you guys report that it is safe.
Me either Bricketh. I loved the live for the same reason. I found the live guide far superior.
aaronwt, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that your Mini will want to have the same UI as whichever DVR it connects to\xe2\x80\xa6 so if you have a Mini flipping between a Bolt with Hydra and a Roamio with Encore, it could be ugly with continual prompts to change.
\xe2\x80\x9caaronwt, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that your Mini will want to have the same UI as whichever DVR it connects to\xe2\x80\xa6 so if you have a Mini flipping between a Bolt with Hydra and a Roamio with Encore, it could be ugly with continual prompts to change.\xe2\x80\x9d
From my vague memory of a reading of the TCF thread a couple of days ago, I thought it was worse than just continual prompts. I thought a Mini simply won\xe2\x80\x99t work with a DVR on a different UI. But I could well be wrong.
I read it the same way as Chucky\xe2\x80\xa6   if you attempt to connect to the newer UI from a older UI Mini, it will prompt to update, and vice versa.   I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine it is not a quick process to revert on the Mini, with minimally 2 reboots during the process (which take 3-5 minutes for the Mini 2).  
hat said, I am expecting that is what Dave meant, when trying to go back and forth between the two units.
Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve confused quite a few people today on multiple points. I\xe2\x80\x99m so Twitter-concise, I can no longer be understood. :) The way I understand it, if the Mini doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match the host DVR, it\xe2\x80\x99ll prompt to upgrade or downgrade to become operable.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so Twitter-concise, I can no longer be understood.\xe2\x80\x9d
amn. I\xe2\x80\x99m dreading 280 characters as a reader, but I guess you should be dreading it as a tweeter\xe2\x80\xa6
t least he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end all of his blog posts with hashtags.
sounds like we are going to be in for a long but hopefully fun ride!
hat sucks that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just upgrade a mini on it\xe2\x80\x99s own and not the host box. Would allow many to test out the new interface without having to destroy all our recordings if we change are minds since no recordings are on the mini\xe2\x80\x99s.
arly upgrade form is here. Will update post to reflect later. 
Can\xe2\x80\x99t yet tell you it works. Or works without issue. Should know in a few hours. 
nd I guess I missed where the Mini Vox comes with Encore u til it connects to a Hydra Tivo\xe2\x80\xa6   I figured that\xe2\x80\x99d be my loophole.
I posted this on TCF, but posting here too, in case someone has this experience to share.  
If anyone is using Hydra on a Roamio (plus or pro) please post your thoughts on the performance, including snappiness of the UI.
on-scientifically, moving through UI, animations, in/out of live TV all real smooth and efficient. Apps still to slow to load but can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s same, better, worse. 
on\xe2\x80\x99t upgrade yet if you have Minis. They\xe2\x80\x99re getting stuck in a loop and want the definitive self help steps to correct or TiVo to fix on their end before encouraging folks. 
Ok both my minis are updated. Power cycled, quickly forced a connection, walked away for 20 minutes, power cycled again. Will try to cover during daughter\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon nap. 
I am too weak, just opted into New Hydra Experience.  Now I wait 2-3 hours before I force my connection to TIVO.  If I find any issues will post here and on 
Wow, no pc to TiVo (i.e. pytivo). Any hints as to when that might arrive?
lso curious what other solutions for PC to TiVo transfer folks are using. Is Plex what all the kids are using these days?  Something else?
Oh and is Plex working on the new UI?
I updated the post \xe2\x80\x93 folks with older, first generation TiVo Minis should be aware those older remotes do not have a \xe2\x80\x98back\xe2\x80\x99 button and the left directional button no longer send you back\xe2\x80\xa6 Zoom button will perform the same function. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any 1st gen Minis, but even so it\xe2\x80\x99s still going to take some retraining.
I have a first gen Mini but I use a newer remote with it since I use the RF dongle. I plan on upgrading it shortly. Actually after spending some time with the new OS, I am even upgrading my main Tivo. Overall I really like Hydra.
I just tried Plex on my Bolt with Hydra. It seems to be working fine.
But I\xe2\x80\x99m also not a big user of Plex. I set up PLex on my TiVo PC and another one as a test. But the things I looked at in PLEX from teh Hydra Bolt, were working like before the Hydra update..
Hydra is a truly horrible grey and drab user experience that discards Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLive guide\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 one of the things that set the device apart from cable provider interfaces. A user interface that is totally non-intuitive. And I was the dummy that dove in not realizing I can\xe2\x80\x99t roll back without losing my programs.
oamio and 2 minis updated. Roamio upgrade was clean. The minis hung for 90 minutes. I rebooted roamio (pulled plug) then did same for minis and all are updated now.  So far I like it but just getting started.
You know the upgrade isn\xe2\x80\x99t being sought by the masses when you can\xe2\x80\x99t find a single video on YouTube of the interface in action on the first day of release.
\nWhich is a trainwreck of a youtube video \xe2\x80\x93 so many things going on that begs questions, and so many things to notice\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9dIs that a hamster ball?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he just reading a press release?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat spread is she putting on that bagel?\xe2\x80\x9d
Just to be clear, I can choose not to upgrade and keep my Live Guide forever??
o idea about forever. But it is an Opt In upgrade.
I liked the Hydra UI so much, I updated all my TiVos to it today. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the old UI. Now while I will miss the Live Guide that I used for over fifteen years, the changes that Hydra brings are worth losing it to me.
\xe2\x80\x9cI liked the Hydra UI so much, I updated all my TiVos to it today. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the old UI.\xe2\x80\x9d
Can you describe or list what you like about Hydra, aaronwt? Genuinely curious.
veryone should sit down for this one, but at a certain point, the Sun will expand to engulf the Earth, and there are serious doubts Encore will still function properly then.
I like the more modern interface. I really, really like the Episode strip when viewing your records or shows you have from your One Passes.. And then you can quickly and easily see the actors and the names of the characters they play when you drill down into more info. The larger preview window is great. Larger Fonts. It\xe2\x80\x99s been quick and snappier from all my TiVos. They even have a list for paused shows. Off the top of my head those came to mind.
Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect and no UI ever has been. But for their first iteration I am pleased with it. And have not run into any bugs yet that I would consider show stoppers.
\nFortunately, in my setups, I have not run into anything that has cause me issues with my primary use for my TiVos. Which is being able to see and hear my recordings when watching them.
eems that the Roamio voice remote is out of stock. Or not released yet? Unsure.
My Vox remote, without dongle, is supposed to ship today from Amazon.
Is there a way to make sure I never get this update?
o. Right now it is Opt In. But there is no guarantee, that at some point in the the future, they push it out with no choice to the user..
I just know that I am glad I upgraded to Hydra. Now I just need to convince my GF to do it. It took her awhile to update to the HDUI. So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will take her awhile to update to Hydra.
Quick question \xe2\x80\x93 anyone else reporting that old slide remotes are no longer working with the RF dongles w/ gen1/2 Minis?  Mine stopped working and not sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s my hardware, or a larger phenomenon
xactly what is the URL for this site? \xe2\x80\x9cgo to a page on the TiVo website and request the upgrade for any TSN that is on your account\xe2\x80\x9d
My RF dongle on my Gen 1 Mini is still working fine. I am using a Bolt remote with it. It works like it did before Hydra in RF mode. So far everything been running great with Hydra on my Bolts, Roamio, and Mini.
Has anyone actually tried pyTiVo after installing Hydra?  I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the behavior is.  Wondering if the \xe2\x80\x9cDevices\xe2\x80\x9d item just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show / doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an equivalent? Or is it maybe an issue in pyTiVo itself?  If it is with pyTiVo I want to try to get with the pyTiVo folks and see if there is a fix possible over there.
I just have a Tivo Bolt + (older version) and just received a TiVo Vox remote that I had ordered, but before I install it I had a couple of questions.  I was wondering if the guide still has the filter option.  When I am trying to find the channel for a sports game I will usually filter the guide so it only shows Sports (you can do the same for movies).  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard if that feature has been added.  One thing I read said that the voice activation had trouble finding sports events for example if you say \xe2\x80\x9cwatch the World Series\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwatch the Bruins.\xe2\x80\x9d  
Have they actually released the hardware specs for the Tivo Bolt VOX?  A couple of articles that I read said that the Tivo Bolt Vox is the same hardware as the older Tivo Bolt + but where are they getting this information from?  There is an article written from the Verge that may be the source of this information.  It said that it looks the same, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the actual processor or memory and the hardware specs on the Tivo site don\xe2\x80\x99t mention those specs.  Not sure if they are getting this information from Tivo directly or if they have more specific info that they did not release.  I was just wondering if there had been any upgrade to the processor or memory (I understand its the same number of tuners and HD space) since I had just bought the Bolt + just weeks before the Vox was released.   
iVo VP Ted Malone told me the Bolt hardware is the same, which I suspect is the case for all the parts that matter. But he\xe2\x80\x99s new on the job and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done a teardown, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t independently confirm.
Ok thanks Dave, if the Vice President told you \xe2\x80\x93 I take his word!  Thanks
I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about ditching Directv because the new Genie GUI software update is horrible and I always found Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s GUI to be superior.  One thing though that I noticed on a Youtube run through of the Hydra interface is that the progress bar now casts a dark shadow at the bottom of the screen.  This is one of the things that Directv changed in the software update and it is a change for the worse.  Is there any way to lessen the footprint of the progress bar on the Hydra interface?
Been running Hydra for a little while now.  The new UI/UX is not to my taste (yes, it *looks* great, but it is very unintuitive), but that\xe2\x80\x99s a subjective thing.  
he bigger issue is that this software is seriously buggy!  Channels disappear, Sound has issues, It tells you the latest connection succeeded when it has failed for 3 days straight.
But the biggest issue \xe2\x80\x93 Shows are often not recorded:  I verified via the To Do list that an upcoming football game is scheduled to record and came back at what I hoped would be halftime and found the game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t recorded!  This has happened on multiple occasions.  This should be the bare minimum that a DVR can do.
I advise everyone wait at least a couple of releases before \xe2\x80\x98upgrading\xe2\x80\x99 to Hydra.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no shows fail to record since I upgraded to Hydra eight days ago. And I have over 200 One Passes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also had zero audio issues with Hydra. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve not noticed any channels disappearing from my OTA TiVos or my TiVos on FiOS.
I have a One Pass to record every NFL game broadcast. It recorded them all as normal since upgrading to Hydra.
Over 200 One Passes ? Wow. I bow to The Master :)
o it seems I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a pretty significant problem in the Hydra upgrade that they\xe2\x80\x99re not drawing attention to. However, customer service was aware and the fix is\xe2\x80\xa6 well pretty easy.
I have parental controls set. After the Hydra upgrade, none of my saved recordings would play. They all come up with an error indicating that they can\xe2\x80\x99t be played, and refer me to error P103 (tivo.com/help/p103). If you look at the details it shows this error relates to Parental Controls.
Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x93 all my previous recordings won\xe2\x80\x99t play because they are protected by parental controls \xe2\x80\x93 and the system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prompt for the parental controls pin. The easy workaround is to either disable parental controls, or just unlock it for 4 hours with the menu.
I, too discovered the Parental Controls issue but none of my shows would play \xe2\x80\x93 even the ones that passed the Parental Controls restriction.  Someone in the forums suggested disabling PC and it worked, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a totally unacceptable glitch.  This is a system that is designed to know the patterns of those watching \xe2\x80\x93 for instance, kid shows are supposed to be displayed during kid hours, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not smart enough to operate with parental controls enabled.  How this was not discovered before rollout is beyond me.
What I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised the most by now is the fact that there is no bug report system for Hydra. (Is there?) Aside from a disgusting thread on TCF, I see no place to submit that P103 bug so they can track and resolve it.
@Dave Zatz do you know of some backchannel bug report form?
I bought the new remote and upgraded, I have a roamio pro. I have been with TiVo since the first tivos, I love TiVo but HATE this update, I would give anything to be able to downgrade back to the old version but keep all my shows and settings and have it like it was, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the voice remote but need the old experience, I hate this one.
I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same position as you\xe2\x80\xa6have a TiVo Pro and bought a new Vox Remote. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken the plunge yet though with the upgrade. The kids and I have watched video demonstrations of it on YouTube. The kids like the look of it. I do too. However, I\xe2\x80\x99m ultimately nervous about it. 
Please help! What do you not like about it? Why would you like to switch back? What are the specific things you don\xe2\x80\x99t like? (I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose my shows, if I want to revert back. I have multiple seasons of multiple shows) 
hanks in advance! Your input is appreciated\xe2\x80\xa6
We\xe2\x80\x99d like to switch back too\xe2\x80\xa6 losing all recordings would suck and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having luck offloading to computer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have much time to mess with it.
Why? What don\xe2\x80\x99t y\xe2\x80\x99all like about it\xe2\x80\xa6to the point that you want to switch back?
oes anyone reading this \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 the Hydra interface?
I like the interface fine though I could provide a long list of improvements they could make. As a software developer I would love to be able to look at the code.
\nMy Roamio OTA works pretty well and the interface is fast. My only frequently recurring problem is the Guide tells me I have no channels selected. I can fix it by going into the Channel List and adding then removing a channel, go back Live and it works. This happens many times a day.

his remote control updates your obsolete Tivo box (with a download of the new "experience" software that changes the layout of clickables on your TV screen) -- into a voice controller.
It "pairs" itself with the Tivo Bolt -- you have to work a little harder for older models - and it comes with the newest Tivo model.
HOWEVER - and this is no fault of TiVo\'s so no stars off for this Remote - getting the "codes" into the remote to make it control older (7 years +) TV\'s may be harder, especially if you want this remote to Control a separate (optical cable connected) Home Theater sound system that is 3 or 4 years old.
iVo has done a wondrous thing, here -- massive addition of value to a ridiculously over-priced item you have connected to a "lifetime service" account at TiVo which juggles and sorts TV programs from Cable, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.
It does not provide all the functions of all the equipment you might have connected to your TV, and has the usual long list of possible "codes" that would enable various models of various brands of equipment.  Very tedious going through the list.  I found oldest models listed first, which helped.
But TiVo has made a great start with voice-control retrofitting.  I love my TiVo Bolt and Mini that makes other TVs work with the TiVo data sorting.  To understand what a TiVo "is" and what it can do for those heading toward dropping Cable and OTA antenna, you just have to find someone who has it and will let you play with it.  The Bolt model is fantastic.  The business philosophy demonstrated by this upgrade of older equipment is a "wave of the future" -- and very refreshing.  I just love this thing.  Voice control may not be your priority now, but it may easily become so.
IVO VOX remote works great with my TIVO Bolt, but would not RF pair to a Mini without a dongle for the Mini that is not included unless you buy the remote directly from TIVO. Without this pairing the Voice button will not work with the new TIVO Experience and you only have an IR based remote.

ivo Has Nailed Voice Control -- Worth the Wait
"Tivo made us wait quite a long time to get a voice-controlled remote, but they have really nailed it. I paired this with my existing Tivo Bolt -- took just a minute and was easy to do, although I did have to use the advanced pairing since it didn't automatically connect. I was surprised that the bluetooth connection actually works better than my old RF Tivo remote -- much faster and more responsive when you hit a button. Wow. Even better, I have my TiVo in a closed closet and the Bluetooth seems to connect more reliably RF."
hen there is the voice control. First, make sure you have the new TiVo update, which you can request directly at Tivo.com (although I\'m sure it will be automatically downloaded to all customers soon). It understands my voice extremely well, even with noise in the room. You can ask for things like a tv station "NBC" and it will take you directly there. Ask it for a game like "Michigan Football" and presto, you get the next upcoming game with the option to record. Or ask it for a show you have recorded, and it also pops up to start watching. For the most part, it understands everything you ask it, but when I asked for "60 Minutes" it couldn\'t help. Not sure why, but I\'m sure they\'ll keep refining it.
"Finally, I like the new Tivo interface, but it has a few quirks. First, they took away my favorite version of the TiVo guide -- not sure why. I guess now with the voice remote, it won't matter much. It also seems to show recorded episodes with the oldest showing first -- I prefer the opposite. Overall, it's gotten a little overwhelming and confusing, but perhaps will get better once I use it more."

"WoW, Amazing, this remote was totaly worth the whole software upgrade (Tivo Experience) Not only can you say what show you want to watch but it will also bring up the channel. All you have to say is the Channel # or say what channel, HGTV or ESPN, etc. Pairing was easy and fast. If your that one person that has to write a negative review on setup, that means YOU did it wrong. I have had no issues with picture quality. Remember you must upgrade to the new Software first (which takes up to 3 days to do from the time of request), eventually it with come automatically, but for now you must request this with Tivo, It will not automatically happen. By the way none of the buttons are lighted, just like the old remotes, so don't be surprised. Don't worry you do not have to purchase new Tivo Boxes in order to use the new features, just upgrade the software and remote. The rewind and fast forward are also much faster now."
"Update 11/21/2017: Just activated my second remote, and it works flawlessly. Now moving on to the Mini's with the Remote with USB Dongle."

his works really well! I\'m not overly fond of the button layout, but it\'s basically the same as other TiVo remotes. For this to work on my TiVo Bolt, I had to have TiVo support upgrade my Bolt unit with the "New Experience" guide software. It took them a little more than 24 hours to do that, but once it was updated the remote worked as advertised. Great voice searching capabilities. The upgraded guide is free, but I believe if you have a unit that\'s older (different model) than the Bolt, then you will need some kind of accessory unit to make those older TiVos compatible with the Vox Remote.

Before you buy the new VOX remote, try the new user interface, "Tivo Experience." If you like the UI, buy the remote. If you do not, don\'t waste your money. I do not like the new Experience UI - it is a huge departure from the user friendly Tivo UI. If you install Experience you must acknowledge that a downgrade will erase everything on your box. The process to downgrade from Experience is navigate to the Menu > Help > Reset to Defaults > Repeat Guided Setup. Enter Thumbs Down > Thumbs Down > Rewind > Rewind to display the Downgrade Your Tivo Box screen. All of your settings and recordings will be erased. The great Tivo UI has been altered dramatically = very bad change.

"The new interface required for voice really misses the boat in usability.  The fonts are hard to read.  Basic navigation  takes more steps than previously, e.g., 5 steps to get to standby, 'playing' a show under my shows requires two steps after it is found (believe it, the PLAY button does not do anything!).  'My Shows' always goes back to the top of the list, not from where you left off.  'Deleting' a single episode also requires two steps (CLEAR opens another menu)."
"The long awaited voice commands are incomplete, e.g., you can 'GO TO' a station call letters but not it's channel number.  PLAY show does not."
earch for ACADEMY AWARD WINNERS finds nothing.
It has a nice large preview screen on the main menu, but it shrinks as soon as you do anything!  It has a visual strip for things to do, but it seems to be random, i.e. it does not show your recordings from the beginning or from where you left off, but rather from some random location and often with shows already viewed.
IVO, if you read this, please clean it up.  New interfaces should be smoother, easier to read, require fewer steps for basic functions.  You failed on all counts.

 Step backwards-- Not a learning Remote- Stick with the old slide pro remote instead
I am a loyal TiVo user for the past 10+ years, so I was looking forward to this new VOX remote. and I really wanted it to work for me. Unfortunately, The VOX remote is a step backwards. My old slide pro remote was a learning remote and I was able to program it to turn ON/OFF BOTH the TV and the AV receiver. I CAN\'T DO THATt with the VOX remote.  It won\'t TURN OFF/ON two devices at the same time. Also, to skip  the Ads (which is a GREAT feature), on the old slide remote pro,  I push on the D button and it skips. You can do that on a VOX remote, but to use your voice, you have to push Voice and then speak "Skip", so two steps on the new VOX remote- push button and speak, while one step on the old slide remote- push D.
"I are so disappointed in this new  VOX remote that I  have given up on it and I am not going to use it until it becomes a learning remote. This review is just want to warn others to the new VOX remote's shortcomings"

iVo leaps into the voice command frenzy with the new Bolt Vox
iVo leaps into the voice command frenzy with the new Bolt Vox
2017-10-24T22:15:48.296Z
"\nTiVo doesn't command headlines quite like it used to, but today it showed us that it still has a few tricks left up its sleeves with the "
"The Vox has enough of its own personality to distinguish it from the likes of Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri as the focus here, understandably, is on helping you find the kind of content you want to watch, and the Vox is surprisingly specific. Even better, it's arguably smarter than its competitors as it lets you refine some requests."
Let\'s say you wanted to watch a couple of Arnold Schwarzenegger flicks. You could easily just ask the Vox to, "Show me movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger," but you could also follow up with more specific queries such as, "Only the comedies."\xc2\xa0
I haven\'t tried it myself, but apparently it\'s so specific that you can even say something like, "Show me the movies where he says \'I\'ll be back,\'" and you\'ll see Arnie\'s Terminator films pop up on the screen. (Hopefully, you won\'t have to say it in an Austrian accent.)
he catch is that only around 100 quotes are currently supported, but as 
Beyond that, you can ask the Vox to do simple tasks like "Open HBO Now" or "Open Netflix." The remote has been been redesigned to accommodate a big, blue voice button for accessing these features, and you\'ll also find a dedicated "Netflix" button toward the bottom.
long with the voice command support, TiVo now sports a redesigned user interface featuring a "smart carousel" that studies your viewing history and makes recommendations based on which time of day you\'re watching. This means you might find news programs listed on the carousel in the morning and Netflix stand-up comedy specials at night.
"\nAside from the obvious benefits for personalized viewing, this service could make the TiVo more user-friendly when it's shared by multiple users. In a family household, for instance, the stuff the kids like to watch might pop up in the later afternoon, while the programs the parents like to watch might pop up later in the evening."
"If you're happy with your current TiVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 and again, the Vox isn't really that much different internally \xe2\x80\x93 you'll be happy to learn that you can simply buy a $40 remote that makes the older device function like the Vox. It comes in both black and white, the better to match your older system."
"When the TiVo Bolt Vox proper launches on October 29 at BestBuy, on Amazon and on TiVo's website, you'll be able to pick it up in either a 500GB ($200), 1TB ($300) or 3TB ($500) model. The TiVo Bolt Mini will sell for $180, and is currently listed on "
"Keep in mind, though, that you'll also need to pay for a one-year contract priced at $15 a month to even use the thing."

\r\n                Looking forward to "voice operated" remote and as usual, I\'d much rather place an order with Crutchfield than with Tivo themselves...they never get the order right.  Crutchfield has been our choice for years and years, never let us down.  Thanks.\r\n

I just called Tivo and got my replacement Tivo Remote Control for FREE! Woohoo!\n\nI have an old Tivo HD box that I have for years. My old HD Tivo still works great, but I can\'t say the same for the remote control. I probably dropped it on the floor too many times and it finally died. I thought I would have to buy it on ebay and see how much I need to spend for the replacement (looks to be about $25-$30). But before I made the purchase online, I begin to wonder if any Tivo remote will even work for my old TiVo Box so I went online to Tivo.com and chat an online support. I was told the new remotes that they have for sale will not work on my old Tivo box and that I should call TiVo sales for further assistance. I\'m so glad I didn\'t make any purchase right away before checking to be sure.\n\nI was thinking, why not, let me call and see how much it will cost for a replacement Tivo remote control, then compare the price from online. After talking to the sales agent and answer some secure questions so that they can look up what Tivo box I have. He then said he will mail the remote to me. I was surprised, confirming with the agent, "for FREE?", and got a reply, "Yes, no charge". I was so thrill to hear it, I saved $25-30 that can go toward foods!\n\nThank you Tivo! You made me a fan again!
hey are having a launch event for their new VOX remote, but made us all wait outside in the pouring rain.
"About a month ago a Tivo sales rep told me they had a Promo upgrading me from my Tivo premiere with life time to a new Tivo Bolt with lifetime transferring my lifetime service, so I said great sign me up and paid for the promo.  The Tivo Bolts were back ordered so I waited and a few days ago I got the Bolt in and went to hook it up today, but it's asked me activate it. It was asking for a service plan, wait what so I called Tivo and this is what I was told.. Yes we see notes on your account that the rep sold you a unit with those terms, but we can't honor it since no promo exists like that for upgrading a Tivo premiere with service transfer to a Bolt. So I said but that not my fault your rep told me about the promo and now your not honoring it, instead they offered to reduce the life time service to 350.00 on top of what I paid for the bolt.

"TiVo.. What happened to you? You used to be the greatest thing. I started with you in 2000 and your product was great. 10 days ago I opened a support ticket. Zero response other than the automated reply.\n\nFirst, opening a ticket when I am logged into your support site should not require me to enter data that you already have. Allow me to choose from data you already have such as my name, address, etc. Please, make it easy for those of us paying for your service, your salary and your shareholders.\n\nSecond, today I contacted support... again, having to enter a lot of data just to get to a support person. When I do reach the person, she (Jennifer) asked me to enter info that I had already entered. And then didn't believe me and had me go to the TiVo box to tell her a third time. Same Data. Really?\n\nVery long waits between her responses. Very poor response. I strongly recommend you go to Amazon.com, order a Tivo device, find a problem with it, try to get support from your own site, and then return it to Amazon and tell me which support experience is 1,000 times easier and customer-focused. Then tell me which company you want to do business with.\n\nAt the end of the support chat, the dialog box offered a customer survey.

"Have had lineup issues since moving to San Diego 6 months ago.  I have mad over 30 calls to TiVo tech support and their executive resolution team.  At one point I had someone following up with me regularly but no corrections were ever made and then they just stopped calling.  I have called in several more times to re-open the case but I just get an overseas tech support rep who wants to follow their script and start with resetting my box.  The customer service staff are just robots, you explain what you need help with and they repeat it back to you...and thats about it...they don't use what you explained to troubleshoot the problem...they just repeat what you said and then start their script.  I have asked for a refund and been told no, I have tried to cancel and I go around and around with he rep trying to talk me out of cancelling but will not listen that the lineup is broken so I won't pay for something that does not work.  Three attempts to cancel and I was on the phone for 40 minutes each time, finally I just hang up because I can't stand arguing any more.  Such awful service and it didn't use to be this way.  When their agents were U.S. based it was excellent service."
"TiVo is turning out to be just like all the Cable providers!  Rotten!  I spoke with Dina yesterday to renew a contract with TiVo and we worked for 30 minutes to restore service.  Gave her my cc info-told me it would take 24 hours to reset.  24 hours later nothing!  Called TiVo and spoke to Will who was so nice and so sorry this happened.  He went to a mgr to get help and he told me he was sorry but Dina didn't complete the work she said she'd do.  Will told me it would take another 24 hours to restore and I asked him to speak to his manager again to escalate the issue.  He came back and told me it would now take an hour.  One hour later...of course it didn't get restored.  By now they are closed for the night and I have to wait another day to speak to someone that probably won't help me!  My confidence in TiVo has plunged!  Please help me TiVo!"
"Long long time customer and I was thinking of adding another unit to my home. Called today and after a long wait finally got ahold of one of the sales guys. He really did not give me very much info to go on, so after a frustrating conversation I gave up. \n   Later I thought lets call tech support and they will surly be able to help with my more techy questions. But to my surprise, I was talking to an Over seas operator. TIVO has NEVER has off shore call centers. but I guess they do now. It to for ever to get transfered back to the USA And when I finally did, I was so upset as I just was always so proud of TIVO for not bailing and sending jobs off shore. And when I tried to call the corporate office the receptionest told me that I had not called Corporate but later said that I had. Please whoever bought out this company please fix it back to what it was in the past. I can't keep supporting this bad customer service."
We have used TiVo for over a decade. Service and customer service used to be great! That is no longer the case.  We are on our 3rd TiVo since August- as our unit we bought a year and a half ago died and the unit sent after that did not work. During this time we have been without consistent service and TiVo has been double charging us in the meantime. Customer service calls and surveys and even emails are not responded to and the reps that we do speak to are not sympathetic and powerless to resolve our problem. \n\nHow something so great has gone so horribly wrong is a mystery but in the meantime we are going to discontinue service.
"A year ago, I disconnected from satellite, for good.  \n\nTivo's product and especially their service has been amazing:\n*purchase the lifetime service, totally worth every penny, no monthly service charges for the life of your box?  WOW.\n*don't purchase the warranty, they desire to retain their customer, call them and they will probably make it happen and keep you satisfied \n\nHATE the remote, but I paid a ONE time fee for years of entertainment.  Just a year of satellite is DOUBLE the price of the equipment and lifetime service.  \n\nLove my streaming shows.  Who has time to watch all that TV?  I realized, I sure don't."
I purchased a TIVO with a lifetime subscription, so no further payments are required. But TIVO insists that I give them a credit card number. There explanation is that we want it.  I love the tiro system but the company sucks.  there is no reason to require a credit card except to invade people privacy. If you do not have a credit card their suggestion is " get someone else to let them use theirs"  What a great (idiotic) idea.
My wife and I recently moved into a new home with her elderly parents.  Our goal was to minimize expenses for all of us while giving them a sense of security for their near future.\n\nThis home is in Time Warner/ Verizon Fios territory and we had the choice of either.  As past customer\'s of DirectTV, we knew we had that choice as well.  Our past experience with Time Warner was not *awesome* and our past experience with DirectTV was good but expensive.\n\nNone of us had ever owned Tivo\'s.\n\nWhen comparing the Time Warner/ DirectTV / Verizon Fios pricing packages for the stations we consider most essential, we were quickly floored by the sticker shock cost of lighting up 5 TVs with DVR service.  Across the board, we were looking at ~$250 per month with the internet service I need for my work.\n\nSo we looked into Tivo.  Tivo had just released their new Bolt DVR, and they have remote devices called "Minis" that can use the tuners in the Bolts.  Bolts have four tuners each for both watching TV and recording it.\n\nVerizon had the best internet packages and we ultimately decided to get their 150MB/150MB internet service plus TV programming that suited our needs.  \n\nUsing the Tivo\'s requires getting Cable Cards (slide in encryption devices) to access cable channels.  At Verizon, these are about $5 per month.  We ordered three for two Tivo Bolt\'s and one for a Silicon Dust HD Homerun Prime streamer for our computers and laptops.\n\nSo now we had 8 tuners to distribute to 5 TVs from the Tivos (I am the only one that ever uses the three Silicon Dust tuners.)  This saved us almost $100 in Verizon set top box rental and DVR service charges.  This is somewhat offset by the Tivo $150 per year ($30 per month) subscription charges for the two Bolts and the $15 in monthly Cable Card rental.\n\nIn the end, we were able to calculate a 23 month ROI on the Tivo box purchases over renting set top boxes and DVR service from Verizon.\n\nBut this is not for the technically faint hearted.  We worked through multiple problems mostly related to the speed of our local ethernet network (1GB, but local cables that were less than CAT6 posed problems), and the speed of our coaxial network (less than RG6 local cables posed problems).  I also found we needed to terminate unused coaxial cable connections with appropriate 75 ohm terminators.\n\nOne of our original Bolt\'s had a tuning problem, which took about two weeks to work out with Tivo support.  Tivo support was great, but could not grasp that with two Bolts, one had tuning problems and the other did not on the same cables and in the same location.  I had to replace the Cable Card to prove to them that the Bolt was having problems.\n\nAs to the Tivo experience, it is without peer.  We love the streaming apps + TV tuner capabilities and the Minis expand to our 5 TVs in an economical way that just makes sense.  We have the in-laws sharing their own Bolt for the Living room and their bedroom and sharing that Bolt with the guest bedroom.  My wife and I share the other Bolt between the Family Room and our bedroom.\n\nAfter some hiccups with getting speeds to their maximums on our Ethernet, WiFi, and Coaxial networks, we now have a very accommodating system for all involved.  It is amazing to see my father in law binging on TV show marathons in Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. On the plus side, Tivo\'s support remote streaming from Sources like Youtube making it possible to share family videos on your TVs.  \n\nThe search feature is the killer, it will search from both TV programs in your scheduled programming and streaming apps you have subscribed to.  I have never seen better except perhaps in my Roku which is less convenient and out of the current input channel when using the TV tuner.\n\nSo mission accomplished but make sure you are ready for getting all networks, local cables, and required terminations up to speed.  It has been worth it, but it required more work than I expected.  Also, know that Tivo support is real slow to assign fault to their own equipment.  If you need replacements, you may be in for a long haul.
"Bought a new TIVO Bolt 2 months ago because one of my TIVO boxes was tiling premium channels.  Guess what the new TIVO BOLT was even worse.  Fast forward 2 months, after countless calls to TIVO and Comcast it still doesn't work.  Comcast came out 3 times, 2 times with a supervisor and ran every diagnostic in the world on the TIVO and cable system.. All new cables were put it.  We even ran the working TIVO cable to the defective TIVO and it still didn't  work.  TIVO finally agreed to send a new TIVO Bolt.  Today I got a notice saying that it would be a refurbished BOLT.  I have now been on the phone with a TIVO supervisor for over an hour with no budging on their part.  I have been a TIVO customer for eight years.  It is time to junk the whole system.  Worst customer service ever, agent who don't what they are doing."
I had Tivo DVR a dozen years ago and loved it!  In the meantime, I have had to deal with mediocre DVR\'s and associated software with U-verse, Dish & Direct TV.  With an anticipated move to a new house, I decided to purchase a Tivo DVR directly from them and get back to the user friendly system I use to love.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a story about a dysfunctional order/sales system.  I tried to purchase a Roamio Plus DVR, lifetime subscription service & a mini box for around $1,000.  When they placed the order, something went wrong with their order software system, which authorized a charge to my debit card, but the order "died" internally giving the customer service representation an "error message".  I was asked if I would be willing to allow a second authorization of my debit card, but this too failed.  I had been on the phone for about an hour, being put on hold on and off, when I was cut off.\n\nI assumed that the order was somehow placed and all was good.  The next day two more charge authorizations came through on my debit card, now totally some $4,000 in pending charges.  I only found out about the additional charges by looking at my account on-line.  These charges overdrew my account and I had to transfer $2,000 to cover this amount.  It took me another 3 hours on the phone talking to Tivo and my bank to resolve this $4,000 debacle, finally removing all these charges, which had no orders behind them.\n\nThe Tivo customer  service representative I was working with on day 3 of the mess, a Friday, suggested I use another account, which I did, but the error on their order system occurred for the 5th time.  She told me that she would manually enter the order and that I would receive an e-mail confirmation.\n\nOn Monday, I still had not received an e-mail conformation, so I called Tivo, to find that the same thing happened as on all the other orders; an error message occurred, but nobody followed up on it, nobody "manually" entered an order and I have a pending $1,000 charge on my other debit card.  Very poor customer service.\n\nThe last customer service supervisor I talked with, finally suggested I buy a Tivo from "Best Buy" and then Tivo would reimburse any price difference to me, so that I would have my unit in time for the cable guy visit on the upcoming Friday.  I\'m off to "Best Buy".  Wish me luck.\n\nAll through these six days of trying to buy something, I was explained to, told about and reasoned with how their "order system" was not working.  At the very end, I had to explain to the supervisor that we as customers don\'t care what their order software problems are.  We just want to buy their stuff.  I cannot believe that they cannot manually place an order, but they could take my money.\n\nIf it was me, having been in manufacturing, production & quality assurance for 25 years, I would have personally packaged the hardware and personally walked it to FedEx and have it shipped "next day".  Then I\'d get back to the customer as to paying for the equipment.  I mean I was a good risk.  I had committed $5,000 of my money towards the purchase of $1,000 worth of goods from Tivo.  Customer loyalty is a very tenuous thing.  Hopefully, I will love my new Tivo, otherwise .....
BUYER BEWARE!!!  When I called TIVO to set up service, I said I "want to try you out." The rep answered, "Then you\'ll want our month-to-month service."  THIS IS MISLEADING AND A DOWNRIGHT LIE. I cancelled after 4 months and was slapped with a $75 cancellation fee and was told that the "month-to-month is actually a one-year contract," something that was not told to me when I started service. \n\nBOO. HISS.
I was a longtime TIVO subscriber and happy with their service.  In July, 2015 we had a house fire.  We were displaced for a year and our TIVO box was a casualty of the fire.  I called TIVO and explained the situation and cancelled our service as the box was destroyed.  In October 2015, without notice, TIVO resumed billing for the destroyed box.  The box that I told them no longer existed.  I just recently noticed the charge.  OK, human error on their part - I\'ll call and fix this.  Well, their response was that this problem was a "shared responsibility."  Essentially, even though I called, told them the box was destroyed and cancelled my TIVO service - that I should be on the lookout for TIVO just deciding to start billing me again.  While I agree that I should check my credit card bills more carefully - I also believe that I should be able to trust a company when I call and cancel a service.  After the fire I canceled many home-related services (cable, phone, garbage, etc.) and none of them resumed billing prematurely.  Sheesh - even Comcast was more ethical than TIVO.  Thumbs down.  No ethics.
ervice over the 5-6 years that I had tivo stagnated and cable companies eclipsed Tivo..  \n\nWhen time came to cancel the service, they offered to "suspend" my billing so I can try and sell the Series 3 HD equipment... \n\nI tired, but I could not even give it away for FREE!\nI cancelled the service in July of 2015, But, Tivo conveniently kept on billing me every month automatically against my checking account..\n\n8 Months later, I am realizing they are still stealing my money after cancellation AND confirmation emails stating it was cancelled..  \n\nSo, I called them today explaining that they have been fraudently charging my account for 8 months..  The "specalist" on the case said, sorry, they can only refund me 90 days... \n\nI\'m like, WHAT??  You have been stealing money from my bank account systematicaly for 8 MONTHS!!! And you claim I can only get 90 days worth???\n\nThis company is beyond corrupt..\n\nAfter 15 minutes of transferring and talking to more "specialists" and supervisors, eventually the agent, after threathing them with reporting fraud and theft, she goes: "Ok, looks like we forgot to click the cancel button when you called in March.. we\'ll refund your money"\n\nRUN..RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!
"Tivo used to have reasonable customer service.  Now it sucks.  Called and was told the wait time was approximately 20 minutes.  After 2 HOURS on hold I gave up.  Their website was not only NOT helpful with my issue but it provided ABSOLUTELY WRONG information/solution.  However, the hardware/product remains great . . . Just hope and pray you don't need customer support because you might die of old age before you get it."
I have a TIVO device that I rent via my cable company for $20/month (plus $10 for the mini). The system seems to work very well though it has a few things I do not enjoy like having to delete each and every program one at a time twice. Some of the menus take time to learn. \n\nMy complaint and low rating is based on the potential purchasing of a TIVO.\nI would advise anyone who wants to purchase one to make sure you understand what you are paying for prior to purchase.. \n\n1. The $500 lifetime service agreement only applies to the actual unit you purchase.\nIf the unit goes into service and it is deemed by them it needs to be replaced the service agreement ends! This means you have to purchase another service agreement for the replacement unit if you want one.\n\n2. Even if you purchase a warranty it does not cover all labor and parts in certain circumstances and you must pay for a replacement. You also have to pay for transportation costs.\n\nAfter speaking to the TIVO agents I came to the conclusion if TIVO will not fix their equipment at no cost under warranty due to component failures 100% and will not make the service agreement continue to units they replace at no additional fee it is best to not purchase the device and service.
nyone with the series III TiVo received an on screen message on Friday, April 3. The message in your TiVo display said "the Amazon and YouTube applications will not be available on this DVR as of April 16, 2015. You will not be able to purchase or download titles from Amazon on this DVR. However, you will be able to continue to watch the movies/TV episodes you purchased an already downloaded within the now playing list."\n\n I contacted TiVo and was told that this was a decision mutually agreed upon by Amazon and TiVo.  TiVo stated that both Amazon and TiVo I had upgraded their software and elected to leave  thousands of series III tiVo customers behind. \n\n As a TiVo subscriber with a lifetime subscription and also as an Amazon prime customer this truly sucks.
"I would give 0 stars if I could.  I bought a romeo box from tivo that didn't work from day one.  Was suppose to be new but I think it was refurbished.  When I called to return box for credit.  They told me they would not do that.  Their customer service sucks.  Better ways to cut the cord than using tivo.  Table or magna vox new 1tb machine with no monthly fees."

"I have an old Tivo HD box that I have for years. My old HD Tivo still works great, but I can't say the same for the remote control. I probably dropped it on the floor too many times and it finally died. I thought I would have to buy it on ebay and see how much I need to spend for the replacement (looks to be about $25-$30). But before I made the purchase online, I begin to wonder if any Tivo remote will even work for my old TiVo Box so I went online to "
I was thinking, why not, let me call and see how much it will cost for a replacement Tivo remote control, then compare the price from online. After talking to the sales agent and answer some secure questions so that they can look up what Tivo box I have. He then said he will mail the remote to me. I was surprised, confirming with the agent, "for FREE?", and got a reply, "Yes, no charge". I was so thrill to hear it, I saved $25-30 that can go toward foods!
hank you Tivo! You made me a fan again!

"TiVo is turning out to be just like all the Cable providers! \xc2\xa0Rotten! \xc2\xa0I spoke with Dina yesterday to renew a contract with TiVo and we worked for 30 minutes to restore service. \xc2\xa0Gave her my cc info-told me it would take 24 hours to reset. \xc2\xa024 hours later nothing! \xc2\xa0Called TiVo and spoke to Will who was so nice and so sorry this happened. \xc2\xa0He went to a mgr to get help and he told me he was sorry but Dina didn't complete the work she said she'd do. \xc2\xa0Will told me it would take another 24 hours to restore and I asked him to speak to his manager again to escalate the issue. \xc2\xa0He came back and told me it would now take an hour. \xc2\xa0One hour later...of course it didn't get restored. \xc2\xa0By now they are closed for the night and I have to wait another day to speak to someone that probably won't help me! \xc2\xa0My confidence in TiVo has plunged! \xc2\xa0Please help me TiVo!"

Long long time customer and I was thinking of adding another unit to my home. Called today and after a long wait finally got ahold of one of the sales guys. He really did not give me very much info to go on, so after a frustrating conversation I gave up.

We have used TiVo for over a decade. Service and customer service used to be great! That is no longer the case. \xc2\xa0We are on our 3rd TiVo since August- as our unit we bought a year and a half ago died and the unit sent after that did not work. During this time we have been without consistent service and TiVo has been double charging us in the meantime. Customer service calls and surveys and even emails are not responded to and the reps that we do speak to are not sympathetic and powerless to resolve our problem. 
How something so great has gone so horribly wrong is a mystery but in the meantime we are going to discontinue service.

 year ago, I disconnected from satellite, for good. \xc2\xa0
"Tivo's product and especially their service has been amazing:"
HATE the remote, but I paid a ONE time fee for years of entertainment. \xc2\xa0Just a year of satellite is DOUBLE the price of the equipment and lifetime service. \xc2\xa0
"Love my streaming shows. \xc2\xa0Who has time to watch all that TV? \xc2\xa0I realized, I sure don't."

I purchased a TIVO with a lifetime subscription, so no further payments are required. But TIVO insists that I give them a credit card number. There explanation is that we want it. \xc2\xa0I love the tiro system but the company sucks. \xc2\xa0there is no reason to require a credit card except to invade people privacy. If you do not have a credit card their suggestion is " get someone else to let them use theirs" \xc2\xa0What a great (idiotic) idea.

My wife and I recently moved into a new home with her elderly parents. \xc2\xa0Our goal was to minimize expenses for all of us while giving them a sense of security for their near future.
"This home is in Time Warner/ Verizon Fios territory and we had the choice of either. \xc2\xa0As past customer's of DirectTV, we knew we had that choice as well. \xc2\xa0Our past experience with Time Warner was not *awesome* and our past experience with DirectTV was good but expensive."
"None of us had ever owned Tivo's."
When comparing the Time Warner/ DirectTV / Verizon Fios pricing packages for the stations we consider most essential, we were quickly floored by the sticker shock cost of lighting up 5 TVs with DVR service. \xc2\xa0Across the board, we were looking at ~$250 per month with the internet service I need for my work.
o we looked into Tivo. \xc2\xa0Tivo had just released their new Bolt DVR, and they have remote devices called "Minis" that can use the tuners in the Bolts. \xc2\xa0Bolts have four tuners each for both watching TV and recording it.
Verizon had the best internet packages and we ultimately decided to get their 150MB/150MB internet service plus TV programming that suited our needs. \xc2\xa0
"Using the Tivo's requires getting Cable Cards (slide in encryption devices) to access cable channels. \xc2\xa0At Verizon, these are about $5 per month. \xc2\xa0We ordered three for two Tivo Bolt's and one for a Silicon Dust HD Homerun Prime streamer for our computers and laptops."
o now we had 8 tuners to distribute to 5 TVs from the Tivos (I am the only one that ever uses the three Silicon Dust tuners.) \xc2\xa0This saved us almost $100 in Verizon set top box rental and DVR service charges. \xc2\xa0This is somewhat offset by the Tivo $150 per year ($30 per month) subscription charges for the two Bolts and the $15 in monthly Cable Card rental.
In the end, we were able to calculate a 23 month ROI on the Tivo box purchases over renting set top boxes and DVR service from Verizon.
But this is not for the technically faint hearted. \xc2\xa0We worked through multiple problems mostly related to the speed of our local ethernet network (1GB, but local cables that were less than CAT6 posed problems), and the speed of our coaxial network (less than RG6 local cables posed problems). \xc2\xa0I also found we needed to terminate unused coaxial cable connections with appropriate 75 ohm terminators.
"One of our original Bolt's had a tuning problem, which took about two weeks to work out with Tivo support. \xc2\xa0Tivo support was great, but could not grasp that with two Bolts, one had tuning problems and the other did not on the same cables and in the same location. \xc2\xa0I had to replace the Cable Card to prove to them that the Bolt was having problems."
s to the Tivo experience, it is without peer. \xc2\xa0We love the streaming apps + TV tuner capabilities and the Minis expand to our 5 TVs in an economical way that just makes sense. \xc2\xa0We have the in-laws sharing their own Bolt for the Living room and their bedroom and sharing that Bolt with the guest bedroom. \xc2\xa0My wife and I share the other Bolt between the Family Room and our bedroom.
"After some hiccups with getting speeds to their maximums on our Ethernet, WiFi, and Coaxial networks, we now have a very accommodating system for all involved. \xc2\xa0It is amazing to see my father in law binging on TV show marathons in Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. On the plus side, Tivo's support remote streaming from Sources like Youtube making it possible to share family videos on your TVs. \xc2\xa0"
he search feature is the killer, it will search from both TV programs in your scheduled programming and streaming apps you have subscribed to. \xc2\xa0I have never seen better except perhaps in my Roku which is less convenient and out of the current input channel when using the TV tuner.
o mission accomplished but make sure you are ready for getting all networks, local cables, and required terminations up to speed. \xc2\xa0It has been worth it, but it required more work than I expected. \xc2\xa0Also, know that Tivo support is real slow to assign fault to their own equipment. \xc2\xa0If you need replacements, you may be in for a long haul.

"Bought a new TIVO Bolt 2 months ago because one of my TIVO boxes was tiling premium channels. \xc2\xa0Guess what the new TIVO BOLT was even worse. \xc2\xa0Fast forward 2 months, after countless calls to TIVO and Comcast it still doesn't work. \xc2\xa0Comcast came out 3 times, 2 times with a supervisor and ran every diagnostic in the world on the TIVO and cable system.. All new cables were put it. \xc2\xa0We even ran the working TIVO cable to the defective TIVO and it still didn't \xc2\xa0work. \xc2\xa0TIVO finally agreed to send a new TIVO Bolt. \xc2\xa0Today I got a notice saying that it would be a refurbished BOLT. \xc2\xa0I have now been on the phone with a TIVO supervisor for over an hour with no budging on their part. \xc2\xa0I have been a TIVO customer for eight years. \xc2\xa0It is time to junk the whole system. \xc2\xa0Worst customer service ever, agent who don't what they are doing."

"I had Tivo DVR a dozen years ago and loved it! \xc2\xa0In the meantime, I have had to deal with mediocre DVR's and associated software with U-verse, Dish & Direct TV. \xc2\xa0With an anticipated move to a new house, I decided to purchase a Tivo DVR directly from them and get back to the user friendly system I use to love."
Unfortunately, this is a story about a dysfunctional order/sales system. \xc2\xa0I tried to purchase a Roamio Plus DVR, lifetime subscription service & a mini box for around $1,000. \xc2\xa0When they placed the order, something went wrong with their order software system, which authorized a charge to my debit card, but the order "died" internally giving the customer service representation an "error message". \xc2\xa0I was asked if I would be willing to allow a second authorization of my debit card, but this too failed. \xc2\xa0I had been on the phone for about an hour, being put on hold on and off, when I was cut off.
I assumed that the order was somehow placed and all was good. \xc2\xa0The next day two more charge authorizations came through on my debit card, now totally some $4,000 in pending charges. \xc2\xa0I only found out about the additional charges by looking at my account on-line. \xc2\xa0These charges overdrew my account and I had to transfer $2,000 to cover this amount. \xc2\xa0It took me another 3 hours on the phone talking to Tivo and my bank to resolve this $4,000 debacle, finally removing all these charges, which had no orders behind them.
he Tivo customer \xc2\xa0service representative I was working with on day 3 of the mess, a Friday, suggested I use another account, which I did, but the error on their order system occurred for the 5th time. \xc2\xa0She told me that she would manually enter the order and that I would receive an e-mail confirmation.
On Monday, I still had not received an e-mail conformation, so I called Tivo, to find that the same thing happened as on all the other orders; an error message occurred, but nobody followed up on it, nobody "manually" entered an order and I have a pending $1,000 charge on my other debit card. \xc2\xa0Very poor customer service.
he last customer service supervisor I talked with, finally suggested I buy a Tivo from "Best Buy" and then Tivo would reimburse any price difference to me, so that I would have my unit in time for the cable guy visit on the upcoming Friday. \xc2\xa0I\'m off to "Best Buy". \xc2\xa0Wish me luck.
ll through these six days of trying to buy something, I was explained to, told about and reasoned with how their "order system" was not working. \xc2\xa0At the very end, I had to explain to the supervisor that we as customers don\'t care what their order software problems are. \xc2\xa0We just want to buy their stuff. \xc2\xa0I cannot believe that they cannot manually place an order, but they could take my money.
If it was me, having been in manufacturing, production & quality assurance for 25 years, I would have personally packaged the hardware and personally walked it to FedEx and have it shipped "next day". \xc2\xa0Then I\'d get back to the customer as to paying for the equipment. \xc2\xa0I mean I was a good risk. \xc2\xa0I had committed $5,000 of my money towards the purchase of $1,000 worth of goods from Tivo. \xc2\xa0Customer loyalty is a very tenuous thing. \xc2\xa0Hopefully, I will love my new Tivo, otherwise .....

BUYER BEWARE!!! \xc2\xa0When I called TIVO to set up service, I said I "want to try you out." The rep answered, "Then you\'ll want our month-to-month service." \xc2\xa0THIS IS MISLEADING AND A DOWNRIGHT LIE. I cancelled after 4 months and was slapped with a $75 cancellation fee and was told that the "month-to-month is actually a one-year contract," something that was not told to me when I started service.

I was a longtime TIVO subscriber and happy with their service. \xc2\xa0In July, 2015 we had a house fire. \xc2\xa0We were displaced for a year and our TIVO box was a casualty of the fire. \xc2\xa0I called TIVO and explained the situation and cancelled our service as the box was destroyed. \xc2\xa0In October 2015, without notice, TIVO resumed billing for the destroyed box. \xc2\xa0The box that I told them no longer existed. \xc2\xa0I just recently noticed the charge. \xc2\xa0OK, human error on their part - I\'ll call and fix this. \xc2\xa0Well, their response was that this problem was a "shared responsibility." \xc2\xa0Essentially, even though I called, told them the box was destroyed and cancelled my TIVO service - that I should be on the lookout for TIVO just deciding to start billing me again. \xc2\xa0While I agree that I should check my credit card bills more carefully - I also believe that I should be able to trust a company when I call and cancel a service. \xc2\xa0After the fire I canceled many home-related services (cable, phone, garbage, etc.) and none of them resumed billing prematurely. \xc2\xa0Sheesh - even Comcast was more ethical than TIVO. \xc2\xa0Thumbs down. \xc2\xa0No ethics.

ervice over the 5-6 years that I had tivo stagnated and cable companies eclipsed Tivo.. \xc2\xa0
When time came to cancel the service, they offered to "suspend" my billing so I can try and sell the Series 3 HD equipment... 
I tired, but I could not even give it away for FREE!
I cancelled the service in July of 2015, But, Tivo conveniently kept on billing me every month automatically against my checking account..
8 Months later, I am realizing they are still stealing my money after cancellation AND confirmation emails stating it was cancelled.. \xc2\xa0
o, I called them today explaining that they have been fraudently charging my account for 8 months.. \xc2\xa0The "specalist" on the case said, sorry, they can only refund me 90 days... 
"I'm like, WHAT?? \xc2\xa0You have been stealing money from my bank account systematicaly for 8 MONTHS!!! And you claim I can only get 90 days worth???"
fter 15 minutes of transferring and talking to more "specialists" and supervisors, eventually the agent, after threathing them with reporting fraud and theft, she goes: "Ok, looks like we forgot to click the cancel button when you called in March.. we\'ll refund your money"
UN..RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!

"Tivo used to have reasonable customer service. \xc2\xa0Now it sucks. \xc2\xa0Called and was told the wait time was approximately 20 minutes. \xc2\xa0After 2 HOURS on hold I gave up. \xc2\xa0Their website was not only NOT helpful with my issue but it provided ABSOLUTELY WRONG information/solution. \xc2\xa0However, the hardware/product remains great . . . Just hope and pray you don't need customer support because you might die of old age before you get it."

I have a TIVO device that I rent via my cable company for $20/month (plus $10 for the mini). The system seems to work very well though it has a few things I do not enjoy like having to delete each and every program one at a time twice. Some of the menus take time to learn. 
My complaint and low rating is based on the potential purchasing of a TIVO.
I would advise anyone who wants to purchase one to make sure you understand what you are paying for prior to purchase.. 
1. The $500 lifetime service agreement only applies to the actual unit you purchase.
If the unit goes into service and it is deemed by them it needs to be replaced the service agreement ends! This means you have to purchase another service agreement for the replacement unit if you want one.
2. Even if you purchase a warranty it does not cover all labor and parts in certain circumstances and you must pay for a replacement. You also have to pay for transportation costs.
fter speaking to the TIVO agents I came to the conclusion if TIVO will not fix their equipment at no cost under warranty due to component failures 100% and will not make the service agreement continue to units they replace at no additional fee it is best to not purchase the device and service.

Please be aware that TiVo customer service and tech support are notoriously bad. My own experience with them was extremely frustrating: the new Bolt I purchased for $300 soon developed major defects, they sent me a "refreshed" unit with even more defects and I went around and around with them for many months, being continually lied to and misrepresented by their employees (mostly making promises that were never fulfilled). I finally documented all written contacts with them then disputed bogus charges with my credit company - and won! Recommend you check out: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/entertainment/tivo.html. I believe they hope dissatisfied customers will just give and go away, which many do due to the extreme frustration of dealing with this company.

"Loved the idea of the TiVo Box but once we decided it wasn't going to work out for us, we were stuck with making payments for a year. Called to explain why it wouldn't work and they didn't seem to care. I get it's only $15 a month but what a stupid thing to hold on to as a company. Maybe I'd be back, maybe I could find a way to make it work but now I will never use or recommend anyone to use this service. It's too bad."

"I purchased my TiVo over 2 years ago and really appreciated it. They appeared to have spent a lot of time on human interface issues, especially searching for shows. I even went and purchased a lifetime subscription. About a month ago, they made some firmware changes and I noticed two new things that really bothered me; - Before the highlight color was yellow and now it's white; the white is much more glaring, harder to read, and annoying. - Before, when I turned on my TV set using the TiVo remote control, I would have to wait for about 10 secs to get video."
t the same time I would get audio AND control of volume and mute. This was particularly important to me because our bedroom is next to my room and if the volume would come on while my wife was sleep it would disturb her. Since I got control immediately, I could hit the mute button and at worst I would get a short chirp if there was audio going on. Now it takes another 10 secs after video, with the audio at the old volume setting, before I would get control which would be enough to wake her up.
"I contacted TiVo for the first time about a month ago, explained the issue and impressed on them that these changes ONLY occurred after their firmware changes. I still had to call them at least 6 times as well as send them emails and they kept putting me off. They had me reboot the TiVo 4 times, they sent me a new remote control, they interrogated my box several times and had me go through resynching my remote control at least 3 times, etc. The first tech that I talked to stated that it could be the hard drive since, from his experience, if the hard drive started to fail it could impact the TiVo - TV communications. I changed the hard drive and it didn't make any difference."
o see if something in my TV set was causing this. I connected my VCR to the TV, powered it on, and I got video, audio, and control of volume and mute all in 10 secs. Identically how my TiVo used to work. Today, after many calls and delays, they finally agreed to replacing the box but it would be treated as a regular hardware replace. They would be generous and only charge me $79 instead of $149. And I had to send in my box and get a return in 1 to 2 weeks. If I wanted to go a cross-shipment I would have to give them a deposit of $499. So, for a problem that they caused I would have to pay $79 and be without a TV in my room for up to 2 weeks.
"I am very disappointed and frustrated with them. If I could be assured that they would really replace my box with a new one, transfer my lifetime subscription, and have everything work like it did a month ago I'd pay the money but I don't have confidence that this would really happen. I no longer have confidence in TiVo since they don't stand behind their product."
"I went out and bought a TiVo Bolt and Mini thinking that would be the answer to my frustration with high cable TV prices. I got the hardware installed and signed up for everything online, give them a credit card number for month by month subscription until I decided whether the service was right for me or not. After a few months I realized that it really didn't give me what I needed. I still had to subscribe to Netflix Hulu Amazon in order to give all of the programming that I wanted and TiVo just didn't seem worthwhile."
"I went online to try to cancel my subscription but after being able to do everything else online discovered that the one thing they won't let you do online have to call and talk to somebody. I tried calling but got frustrated waiting in the queue so gave up. About that time the credit card I was using expired so I decided to simply let the subscription end for non-payment. Now they are billing me for $89 for that nonpayment. When I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay it they turned it over to a collection agency that I am now dealing with. Not to mention a couple hundred dollars of useless equipment. Wish I read the reviews here before getting involved with this awful company!"

"I have been a long time customer of TiVo. Just recently I started having issues with my TiVo Roamio and its HDMI port. I called tech support and they had me go through all the basic steps, which I understand. My TiVo Roamio was deemed 'defective' and support sent me out a replacement. The replacement box that I received was defective and would hardly boot up before rebooting itself. I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again. They deemed that the replacement box was defective, so they sent me out another box. I received the 2nd replacement box and yes, that too was defective. It wasn't an issue with booting up this time, it booted up but the screen was pixelated to the point where it could hardly be read. I started doubting myself here and tested many different scenarios - different HDMI cables, different TVs, etc - nothing."
"I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again (now it's starting to get a little old) - and they deemed this box defective as well. They sent me out another box. Keep track here, this is the 3rd replacement box. This box worked! Was on a brand new (Completely different brand) TV, UPS, top of the line HDMI cable, anything I could think of that would cause an issue like this. After about 45 days - the HDMI stopped working. I called support, I explained the issue, they had me go through all the troubleshooting techniques and they deemed the box was defective. They were just getting ready to setup a replacement and (this would have been the 4th replacement - my 5th TiVo Roamio) and after a brief hold they told me they did not have any record of my support agreement. They must have some record of what has occurred that shows I had a support agreement, right?!"
"The technical representative was very quick to get me off the line and transfer me to a customer support representative who could look into why I no longer had any record of my support agreement, which don't come cheap if you have ever purchased one. When I finally got to the representative on the phone she saw record of my support agreement and couldn't understand why it was no longer on my account. I was placed on hold, and she came back and said I was no longer eligible to receive replacement boxes. She couldn't explain why - I was asking if I had reached a 'limit of liability' of some sort, but one would think that since I was given essentially 3 faulty replacement boxes that even if there was a liability limit that I would not be subject to that clause. After going back and forth, she said that if I wished, I could extend my warranty for another two years - but I was limited to only ONE replacement box."
"This is outrageous. Why would I pay even more money for the chance that yet another replacement box would work? I find it completely unacceptable and disappointing that TiVo would not only offer such poor support, send out non-functional replacement boxes under their warranty program, but not even stand behind the fact that I have a contract with them to ensure my box is working. I would drop the company all together if I hadn't paid for the lifetime subscription on the TiVo Roamio, and purchased 4 TiVo Minis to work with it. I have a lot invested in this system that is still covered under warranty, but TiVO will not support. Absolutely unacceptable. Buyers beware."
"I upgraded a lifetime service agreement on one of my 2 Premier TiVOs to a new Bolt 10 days ago. The sales rep for TiVO, who was NOT located in the USA, transferred the wrong TiVO Premier lifetime service from a machine I still intend to use. Trying to explain this situation to the various foreign representatives has taken at least 20 phone calls to TiVO and, to date, developed 5 different Case Numbers in the past 10 days. I have requested a representative based in the USA to speak to about this issue. The only thing TiVO has done is to close the Cases without ever talking to me, by voice, or email, or pony express for that matter. This company's customer service is a cruel joke."
We have now owned three TiVos. The most recent being the BOLT. It has just failed and is less than two years old. TiVo insists the only way to transfer our purchase of a lifetime subscription is if they ship to us a new one and we return the nonfunctional TiVo. This whole transaction will take 5 to 6 days. We are requesting that we go and buy a new one now and then ship back to defective one, but TiVo will NOT accommodate us. We would have to buy another lifetime guarantee. This is not customer service! We have spent hours on the phone with TiVo going round and round about this with zero customer service, little to no understanding of what we are saying. They LOVE to put you on hold forever hoping you will hang up or go away. If you are in the market for inferior equipment, horrific customer service and wasting hours of your time, this is your product!
"I purchased a TiVo Bolt. I'm on the road all of the time, so I do not need cable or satellite service. The Bolt works great. The problem is the TiVo Mini's. This is the second one they sent me to fix the problem. It is worse than the first one... The problem is... For those of you who work with computer hardware and software like me. If the wifi card is active and the Ethernet port is also active, they will not be compatible. There is no way to deactivate either one... With so many complaints with this product, you will think they can fix it!!!"
My TIVO Bolt worked for 4 months, but has had issues for over 2 months. Calling support results in the same response. "Unplug the unit, Unplug the modem, do this multiple times" while I am put on hold for 5-10 minutes at a time. Then wait 5-10 days and try it again. When asking to speak to a supervisor usually results in a dropped call. The couple of times I got someone, I was again put on hold for 5-10 minutes. I finally got them to send a new unit, which had a different problem.
fter going through multiple calls, they finally agreed to take the new unit back and send another unit. Surprise, the new unit had the same issue as the first replacement. Now I am told it is a known issue and to wait another 15-20 days for a fix. I have had 14 different service log numbers and spent over 4 hours on the phone with TIVO. I purchased a one year contract upfront, which I now know was a mistake. I plan to cancel as soon as possible and never deal with TIVO again. I rated them a 1 only because there was no 0 option. I hope this save someone the aggravation of dealing with this company.
IVO Discontinued My Lifetime Service. What is the point of paying for Lifetime service if TiVo is just going to cancel it whenever they feel like it? I\'m sure there is something in their legal mumbo-jumbo that allows them to do it but they shouldn\'t be able to call it "lifetime" service if it isn\'t. They should call it "lifetime service until we cancel it", at least that would be truth in advertising. Very sad because I have used Tivo for over 10 years and I hate the idea of using another service.
"Like many others on this thread, I had excellent service and luck with TiVo. I have two Series 2 boxes which have run for 10+ years with little incidents. If/when there were incidents, I'd call the TiVo Tech Support line and they'd invariably help me fix the problem quickly and professionally. In February, I got an email saying the Series 2 boxes would not be supported much longer. They had a great offer to transfer my lifetime service onto a new Bolt. I bought a Bolt and a TiVo Mini to connect to the machine. I then got emails saying the supply was not meeting demand and the delivery was on hold awaiting their manufacturer. I got the new Bolt a few weeks later and got it all running with the TiVo Mini. I really liked streaming off the box onto my phone feature because I travel for business. "
"All was working well until a few weeks ago. I spent 10+ hours on phone with TiVo Support and Verizon as TiVo often blames the provider. Then TiVo sent me a replacement box. I got it, plugged it in, called TiVo to activate. It didn't work. Called Verizon. Spent 3+ hours on phone trying to get it to work. Called TiVo back. Spent another 3+ hours. Finally, I plugged my Series3 boxes back in and they work fine. So, after 20+ hours of working on this, I called TiVo and they're refunding my money. It appears these Bolts are just not working."
"Customer for 9 years. Premiere box in 2008, then Roamio Plus in 2014. Premiere died two years ago (hard drive kaput). Roamio is still alive. The interface for the DVR function is fabulous and the recording function seldom fails. But over the years as streaming and wireless connectivity has taken on a bigger role, Tivo has lagged far behind. During that same timeframe I have owned Apple TV (two boxes) and Amazon box. Never ever an issue with them streaming. Tivo not so much. Once a month Tivo box fails to connect with Tivo's homeland to download the TV listings (without which, Tivo can't record). When that happens, you need to check under the hood and tinker because Tivo support only ever has one solution: reboot your router (then reboot your cable modem then reboot Tivo then start rebooting everything again). "
"I don't even know the support phone numbers for Apple and Amazon because I have never had to call them. Tivo offers a link to Netflix and Youtube just like Apple. Choosing the Tivo link instead of Apple is madness - freezes up midway through any show. Same top of the line router, same distance from it. And the Tivo smartphone app? HaHaHa..."
Purchased three (3) TiVo units that are now 3, 4 and 5 years old respectively - all with lifetime service. Approximately six months ago, the channel guide would not download correctly to all three devices requiring a call into customer support. TiVo acknowledges the problem promising a fix but it has only gotten worse. The temporary fix is to reboot the DVR. After contacting TiVo again for the third time with yet another ticket number, I elected to reach out again by phone.
I first spoke with Muriel who then passed me on to her supervisor, Patrick. In the course of our discussion, Patrick suggested, given the age of my 5 year old unit, that problems are to be expected. I argued, "What therefore, is the value of a Lifetime Service Plan if it is only expected to last 5 years?" Flustered, he proceeded to ramble on with a stream of nonsensical gibberish only to hang up on me.
"Patrick's 5 year admission only serves to confirm that TiVo's long term, life time plans are meaningless. Their business model is based on two elements, 1) monthly service fees and 2) selling new hardware. Bear in mind, there's nothing wrong with my hardware - it's a software issue. As a software developer, there's no easier way for a technology company to render a product worthless than by breaking the software with which its hardware is dependent. TiVo does not want their solutions lasting beyond 5 years - consequently, there's no value in purchasing a TiVo."
"I have had a Tivo DVR since the company's launch. I recently acquired a BOLT after nearly 2 months of fooling around with fixing the #3 generation TIVO. I can't begin to describe the hassle I've encountered -- everything from payment to order to technical support. I suspect that TIVO's recent acquisition by a larger company may have something to do with the problems I've encountered. Now after about 3 weeks of use, the BOLT box I installed isn't working and TIVO is mailing me another. I am ready to pull the plug and use the less user friendly but at least less expensive cable DVR. Don't make an investment in this technology unless you're willing to put up with consistent problems across the board. It's too bad as this used to be a very well run company."
"Like other reviewers, I upgraded my TiVo box, then found out a year later I was being billed for two TiVos... I guess this is standard rip off for them. Now I'm trying to cancel my account, they won't let me! Ridiculous! I will have to cancel the card they are billing. I don't know how to prove I'm trying to cancel this. It's outright robbery. Beware."
I canceled my service two months ago with TiVo after 12 years as a loyal customer. Imagine my surprise when I was billed a couple of days ago for the canceled service. I called today to inquire and was told that the first rep had offered me two months of free service as compensation and since I didn\'t call back to cancel before that time was up, my service was continued and I was billed. Let me be clear, the first rep said he was extending free service so that I could "sell the box" and due to my loyalty. He never once mentioned my having to call back into re-cancel. And now they refuse to refund me for this month. This is very, very poor customer service and TiVo has lost a very loyal customer forever.
"When you call the phone number for Tivo, you no longer get a person in the United States. They no longer have any representation here. If you think as an American I am giving my information to total strangers in the Philippines, think again! Tivo has completely gone downhill. Worst company ever. No wonder everyone has billing issues. And they will lie and tell you that no one can talk right now in the States... Do you get this. There is no more USA jobs for Tivo or Tivo support!!! Know how I know, the supervisor in the Philippines told me so!!! Don't buy a Tivo. They are no longer a good company. It is terribly sad. It's all about them getting your $$$."
I ordered top of the line Tivo, Tivo Mini and service. Received product and when I connected, I was told it would not work with my equipment or service. I immediately returned $1000.00 worth of equipment and was told I would be refunded within 10 days of them receiving it. It has been 20 days and still no refund. When I try to contact customer service, I am disconnected. I have tried email and they acknowledge receiving the email but offer no resolution. This is INSANE.
iVo makes it nearly impossible to cancel. They want to bill you forever, even after you\'ve stopped using their service. They let you sign up online, but you can\'t cancel online. I call them and they pretend they can\'t find my account, even though I give them my name and phone number - the info they request and the info my account was registered with. They play games and will probably turn account over to collection agency once it totals a few hundred bucks. The last time I called them to cancel - June 19, 2017 at 14:44, a gal who called herself "Ann" claimed she couldn\'t find my account; refused to give a last name, employee number or any way to really identify her and refused my three requests to speak to a supervisor. BEWARE - CROOKS!
hree months ago I "thought" I was going to "enjoy" Tivo when I discovered the same day of Tivo activation that I had a serious mold issue! Part of the foundation as well as walls and flooring in approximately one third of my home has gone through the long and intricate remediation process of demolition and building! I discovered that my credit card was paying for the monthly Tivo that I had NEVER EVER even had a chance to turn on and watch even a single TV show of any kind!
I called Tivo and asked to have my account suspended as I had this terrible problem! THEY ARE SO GREEDY! No they would not suspend it! They had to cancel for a penalty of 75.00 or I could continue to pay for nothing as well! Very bad customer relation! I think with the loss I have now into this and the BULLY behavior I experienced with this VERY arrogant company that I will just throw this idea away and put it all behind me! I hope anyone who wishes to experience the Tivo service that they research it thoroughly! Very expensive mistake I made in this one sided uncaring company!
When I purchased a new Bolt a year ago, I cancelled service on the old Premiere. I just found out that I have been being charged 14.99 a month for 12 months for that Premiere. Customer support said I never requested cancellation of the Premiere and that I had been carrying two services for the years. They also said they would not refund the money because it had been my responsibility to stop the service.
I want to warn prospective customers that units are expensive, mostly defective and built not to last (tried both Roamio and Bolt). Charged $300 for a TiVo Bolt. Subscription is $14.99/month. Warranty is only for 90 days, after which they try to sell you a "refurbished" unit for an additional cost of $149! Then try to rip customers off further with selling "service agreements". The front green light on my almost 13-month-old Bolt suddenly stopped lighting up. The unit would not respond in any way to the remote. The light on the back was on and I could hear the fan running. I checked online - seems to be a common problem - and went through all the recommended steps, including unplugging the unit, trying to set up again, etc. but nothing worked.
When I called tech support, I was first told that they only offer a 90-day warranty but would send me a "refurbished" unit for a cost of $149. Told them I would not be forced or coerced into paying them AGAIN for a practically new $300 unit. They agreed to send me a \'refreshed?\' unit (with no cords or remote) at no charge. I spent hours transferring my saved programs onto the new unit, with phone help from TiVo. Within a week, the so-called refurbished/refreshed unit started to cut out sound, freeze screen picture and kept losing connectivity with my WiFi (the latter of which was working perfectly with my laptops and printer combo). I then wasted hours on the phone with a variety of tech support and customer service staff. For my "frustration and inconvenience," I was promised a brand new Bolt with attachments. A week later, another "refreshed" unit with no attachments was received.
ince then I have called several times, always maintaining politeness to reps in both tech support and customer service. I was assured that my case would be escalated to a supervisor and promised a call within 3 days - which never came. I called again May 8th, was disconnected several times, even when "escalated" to a supervisor twice (with no call back, despite them verifying my phone number on my account). Bottom line, they sell you an expensive product, charge you a monthly subscription fee, and don\'t give a damn about selling a lasting product or customer service.
I am not writing this to be vindictive, but to warn others not to get sucked into this giant scam. Yes, it\'s a good service - WHEN IT WORKS! Do NOT trust a "refreshed" unit - both a replacement Roamio and Bolt were defective from the start. They also make every effort to get customers to pay another 50% of the cost of a new unit that was only purchased 13 months prior.
"HDMI Input stopped working a couple months after purchase. I called TIVO who not only refused a refund, they charged me $75 to cancel my service early! Terrible company! They know this is an issue (Google it!) and they are scamming people that bought one. Don't EVER do business with TIVO!!"
We have always liked TIVO for 10 plus years until we bought the Bolt and this is a disaster. We are disgusted with TIVO. After a month of not programming properly and TIVO not answering any questions about their problems they finally sent out an email saying the problem was fixed. After doing all they asked we find out they messed up yet again. I would like to know if they are ever going to get this problem with recording one passes. We are so very disappointed in them.
oday, my TiVo Mini just refuse to work. It was working fine yesterday, but today, nope. I tried to do some troubleshooting myself, but it would not work. I called tech support and, after about 30 minutes of unplugging everything, etc., etc., the tech guy said I had to replace the Mini. I believe it is barely more than one year old. So, I have to pay $79 to get another one, but they will not send it out until I Fedex them the broken one. So, this process will take about a week during which time, obviously, no TV service in the main room of the house.
With what they charge for their equipment and service fees, I expect a better quality product. Or, if something happens, I expect them to make it work ASAP and not wait until I find a box to mail them a faulty piece of equipment. I could use the box the replacement is coming in - IF I COULD GET IT. And, as a further insult, TiVo has already charged my credit card for the full amount of the replacement - which is not being sent to me. I will never recommend TiVo to anyone and am considering getting another service, myself.
I have had a TIVO Roamio for a couple of years and have really enjoyed it. I decided to purchase a TIVO Bolt. I started the activation process and found out that I would be committed to paying the monthly price regardless of whether or not I used it. It is absolutely ridiculous that you must purchase their hardware (which would be useless without a subscription), and then be held to pay on a monthly basis regardless of use. I wonder if Donald Trump owns a share of this company. It\'s something he would do to take advantage of people with limited income. I told the "advanced" customer service representative that I did not agree with the terms and he hung up on me. 
"I am returning the TIVO Bolt to Best Buy (letting them know why they need to take the device back) and I am going to find out if I will be committed to a year subscription for the Roamio I currently have when the current year expires. If so, I'm done with that. If more customers refused to be held hostage, TIVO would get a clue and treat us with some respect."
"Terrible customer service and product support. After 2 different TiVos and 4 different cable cards I am still receiving a V52 error. Tivo customer service was rude and condescending. Although this is a known problem with TiVos they act like I'm the only one that has ever had this problem, which is completely untrue. They should not sell a product that they cannot honestly support. Really too bad, this used to be a great company. Unfortunately, not anymore."
Happy customer for over 10 years. I was really surprised to see all the negative reviews. Tivo has state side support and always seem friendly and helpful to me. They stand behind their product better than most companies. But it does come at a price, you buy the equipment and pay a subscription.
"I have no idea how far to go with the horrid support. I have been a Tivo owner since 2004 and simplicity has been the reason... That is gone. I literally lost 2-3 weeks of my life due to a defective unit. Not only did it not work until it was replaced over two weeks later (I requested it be replaced right away) but they insisted to be patient and keep downloading updates even though as long as it was hooked up I couldn't use my tv at all... Two weeks of no tv and missed shows and spending most of my time forcing updates or calling and playing games is absurd. My time is valuable and obviously tivo doesn't seem to care. I even got one support agent talking down to me and literally gaslighting me. No one should get that from tech support."
"The only reason I even got a replacement was because after the abuse I Insisted on talking to a manager as my desire to return it was ignored. He sent one out asap. I asked about a previous unit that was supposed to come to me a week earlier and it was never sent even though support kept claiming it was on its way. They also kept insisting a new unit wouldn't fix the problem even though a new unit worked perfectly out of the box. I lost weeks worth of functionality, time and stress I didn't need."
"It's not too much to ask a company to respect your time is valuable. My time lost could have bought 10 bolts... this refurbished one... which I only bought due to the discounted price wasn't worth it. It's working fine now but I feel compromised keeping it. I just don't want to fight with them anymore. When it expires I highly doubt I will ever use tivo again. If you get the runaround DON'T play their game. Insist on returning it or getting a new one ASAP and insist if it doesn't arrive in time to take it back. Although I doubt they will. You'd think they respect your desire to return things but I can't force them to live up to their legal responsibility without a lawyer."
\n                    TiVo expert review by Jonathan Trout\n                
iVo first appeared in 1999 with the DVR. Today it offers the TiVo BOLT, a streaming device that turns your TV into a smart TV by integrating your favorite streaming apps like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and more. The BOLT comes in a 500GB, 1TB and 3TB storage capacities. That comes out to be about 75, 150 and 450 hours of show and movie storage capability. Pricing starts at $199.99 for the 500GB BOLT, $299.99 for the 1TB and $499.99 for the 3TB.
\n                                You have three options when it comes to TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service plans. You can pay a monthly service fee of $14.99, an annual service fee of $149.99 or an all-in service plan for a one-time payment of $549.99. The monthly plan comes with a one-year commitment and a $75 early termination fee.\n                            
"\n                                By using the TiVo BOLT box instead of your cable provider's box, you can integrate your cable TV subscription with your streaming services subscriptions and puts them all in one place. This lets you avoid monthly rental and DVR fees from your cable company.\n                            "
\n                                SkipMode on the BOLT makes sure you never have to watch commercials again. Not only that, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have to fast forward commercials again. One button lets you skip a whole commercial break and resume your show exactly where it picks up again.\n                            
\n                                4K UHD TVs are slowly creeping into the market as the next big thing. TiVo BOLT is 4K compatible so you can get all the clarity, color and detail your new TV offers.\n                            
\n                                TiVo BOLT lets your record four shows at once for up to 150 hours of HD programming (for the standard model). Watch your recorded shows on your TV or your mobile device.\n                            
\n                                You can stream content from the TiVo BOLT on up to ten TVs as long as you have a TiVo Mini for each TV ($150 each).\n                            
\n                                    people who want to integrate their cable subscription and streaming service subscriptions in one place.\n

iVo Mini VOX/4K reviews and comments thread\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn this the eve of the TiVo Mini VOX/4K, I thought that it might make sense to establish a separate thread where users' reviews and comments on the new Mini could be consolidated.  Feel free to use this thread for that purpose. "
\nI separately have put up a TiVo Hydra/Gen4 User Interface reviews and comments thread and a TiVo  VOX/voice remote control reviews and comments thread (both under the TiVo Coffeehouse - TiVo Discussion sub-forum), to try to make it easier for people to find what they might be looking for.  Feel free to use those threads as well.
\n\t\n Taken from my post on the other thread: the voice control does not work.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJust installed TiVo mini with the Vox. Software loaded but continually crashes to a black screen or a screen with a right pointing arrow. I have two bolts that are the older version of the software is not uploaded on them yet. I ordered two vox remotes. Those haven\xe2\x80\x99t arrived yet. Right now I have a TiVo mini on a black screen but is not doing anything and will not stay loaded\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJust to confirm, I have a Tivo Bolt+, I have a Mini Vox arriving on Tuesday and a couple 2nd gen Tivo Minis.  Once I upgrade the Bolt+ to Hydra, everything else should upgrade automatically and (hopefully) work normally, right?\n\t\t\t\t\t

"My understanding is that you'll need to update your DVR (Bolt/Roamio) before you update the Mini. Some details here (but doen't explain why your screen would be blank): "

"I would suggest disconnecting the cable line (assuming you are using MOCA) or the Ethernet wire, unplugging the power from the Mini and plugging it back in.  Let it fully boot up (and because I am old school, give it a few minutes to stabilize/finish doing it's thing for a bit) before reconnecting the cable/ethernet cord.  Then give it a few minutes to reconnect to the network -- if it doesn't reconnect after a few minutes, do a regular reboot or disconnect the power for 5 seconds (do not disconnect any other cables this time)."
\nI had a similar experience and resolved it this way when I tried to connect a Mini Vox to a Premiere XL4 -- since it failed, I decided to forgo the downgrade and resolved the black screen / white arrow by doing the above.\n\t\t\t\t\t

I am experiencing a similar issue and have tried disconnecting the network cable and rebooting, but to no avail.  It appears it is not connecting to the TIVO server - shows up as last connect June 12, 2017.  If I try to force a connection, as soon as the download starts, about 2%, I get the grey arrow, and then the screen goes black.  I am going to let it sit for an hour - hopefully it is downloading - before I try rebooting again.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUpdate - I let it sit for about 30 minutes and then restarted.  It came up, and when I clicked Live TV button on the remote, I got a white error box - Error V66 - Cable Card needed! On a mini!.  I rebooted again, and now all I get is a blue error across the screen - it won't respond to any buttons on the remote.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJust to clarify, do you have a host TiVo that is already on Hydra?  You need that first, as the Mini needs something to connect to that is already on Hydra.
\nAssuming you already have a host TiVo with Hydra already on it, pull all of the cables again, then plug back in only the power and HDMI (not the cable / ethernet) and see what happens.  If it comes back up, plug in the cable/ethernet and give it some time, and try what I suggested in the previous post.
"\nIf that doesn't bring it back, unplug again and this time plug all of the wires back in (including the network) and see what happens.  Once you get back to the main menu go into Settings, and select a Host DVR that is your Hydra DVR.  Even if you are already set to connect to that box, select it again."
"\nIf that error 66 comes up again, try going to the GUIDE and then picking a channel. If that doesn't solve the issue, try to enter a channel directly (one that you know you get).\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"I'm surprised it wasn't error V666. "

I have tried both scenarios that you suggest.  I cannot get to a guide to select a channel - I get the BLUE ARROW screen right away\n\t\t\t\t\t

"No, 20.7.xx is not Hydra -- that's the Quattro interface.  I believe the Hydra builds are 21.7.xx"
"\nWhat Mini do you have?  The one that has been out for a couple of years, or the new Mini Vox with the voice remote?  If you have the Mini Vox and are not planning on updating the host DVR to Hydra, then I THINK the Mini Vox can downgrade to the prior software, but the voice functionality won't work (since Hydra is needed to use the voice functionality and the host DVR and the Mini must be on the same version).\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"Okay, that's the issue then. The host has 20.7. I am surprised the product was even able to begin setup if that was the case.   The only way I see how to upgrade to Hydra is to submit a form on TIVO.com and wait 48 hours\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you want Hydra, yes.  I think there is a link in the Coffee House, and people are getting it pushed pretty quickly (like an hour or two), but I haven't been following that thread.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"You can submit the TSN to Tivo, it hasn't taken more than 30 mins to an hour if you do a manual connection after submitting.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"It looks like it may have been as simple as that.  The update went thru, I rebooted the Mini box (the new VOX one) and it appears to be working properly.  I'll keep my fingers crossed though.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCool, enjoy it.  The voice functionality (what little I've used of it) is pretty cool.  It seems to understand words far faster than my iPhone 6S does, and the accuracy makes Siri look daft."
\nI\'m currently watching an episode of Madam Secretary on another box.  I walked out to the kitchen to get a drink and picked up the voice remote and from LiveTV I asked "What shows was Tea Leone in", and then separately asked it "What movies was Tea Leone in".  It got both perfectly, so I think (I didn\'t know she was in some much).
\nI then asked it to find movies with Han Solo -- which it transcribed as HANS SOLO, but it found all of the Star Wars movies (including the animated ones which have a Han Solo character). 
"\nThinking about Harrison Ford, I asked it if Apocalypse Now is on (I didn't know if it was airing anytime soon, I just always remember a young Harrison Ford as a corporal at the beginning of that movie) -- it pulled up a option to record it on EPIX."
"\nAll pretty darn cool - I think I am going to need to buy one of these remotes for one of my Bolt(s) just to play with, even though I am a universal remote user.  Heck, since the Mini Vox is in the kitchen, I might just steal the remote and use a Bolt remote in there since I'm not using the Bolt remotes.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI had the same black screen issue. After hours of reboots, etc.  I finally got a message allowing me to downgrade the mini software. (I did not want to go with hydra because of the loss of PC-->Tivo video transfers.) Anyways, I finally got it working with the old interface. I have only 3 apps, Youtube, Pandora and Netflix. Nothing else; no Amazon or xfinity or Plex or anything else is available; no option to manage apps exists. Other than that it seems to work well. Netflix and Pandora seem to be just as snappy as with my bolts. My older slide remote with a USB dongle works fine with the Mini Vox. I can not initiate PC-->Tivo transfers with the mini, but after initiating the transfer on the DVR itself, I can stream the show while it is still transferring.\n\t\t\t\t\t
