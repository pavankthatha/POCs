b'Please be aware that TiVo customer service and tech support are notoriously bad. My own experience with them was extremely frustrating: the new Bolt I purchased for $300 soon developed major defects, they sent me a "refreshed" unit with even more defects and I went around and around with them for many months, being continually lied to and misrepresented by their employees (mostly making promises that were never fulfilled). I finally documented all written contacts with them then disputed bogus charges with my credit company - and won! Recommend you check out: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/entertainment/tivo.html. I believe they hope dissatisfied customers will just give and go away, which many do due to the extreme frustration of dealing with this company.'

b"Loved the idea of the TiVo Box but once we decided it wasn't going to work out for us, we were stuck with making payments for a year. Called to explain why it wouldn't work and they didn't seem to care. I get it's only $15 a month but what a stupid thing to hold on to as a company. Maybe I'd be back, maybe I could find a way to make it work but now I will never use or recommend anyone to use this service. It's too bad."

b"Multiple phone calls and no resolution. Very poorly trained staff, who make you walk through a series of troubleshooting steps each time, even though you just did them. The result is that you can never get anything actually resolved in less than an hour. Also, they ask you questions, then don't listen to the answer \xe2\x80\x93 and ask the same question seconds later."

b"I purchased my TiVo over 2 years ago and really appreciated it. They appeared to have spent a lot of time on human interface issues, especially searching for shows. I even went and purchased a lifetime subscription. About a month ago, they made some firmware changes and I noticed two new things that really bothered me; - Before the highlight color was yellow and now it's white; the white is much more glaring, harder to read, and annoying. - Before, when I turned on my TV set using the TiVo remote control, I would have to wait for about 10 secs to get video."
b'At the same time I would get audio AND control of volume and mute. This was particularly important to me because our bedroom is next to my room and if the volume would come on while my wife was sleep it would disturb her. Since I got control immediately, I could hit the mute button and at worst I would get a short chirp if there was audio going on. Now it takes another 10 secs after video, with the audio at the old volume setting, before I would get control which would be enough to wake her up.'
b"I contacted TiVo for the first time about a month ago, explained the issue and impressed on them that these changes ONLY occurred after their firmware changes. I still had to call them at least 6 times as well as send them emails and they kept putting me off. They had me reboot the TiVo 4 times, they sent me a new remote control, they interrogated my box several times and had me go through resynching my remote control at least 3 times, etc. The first tech that I talked to stated that it could be the hard drive since, from his experience, if the hard drive started to fail it could impact the TiVo - TV communications. I changed the hard drive and it didn't make any difference."
b'To see if something in my TV set was causing this. I connected my VCR to the TV, powered it on, and I got video, audio, and control of volume and mute all in 10 secs. Identically how my TiVo used to work. Today, after many calls and delays, they finally agreed to replacing the box but it would be treated as a regular hardware replace. They would be generous and only charge me $79 instead of $149. And I had to send in my box and get a return in 1 to 2 weeks. If I wanted to go a cross-shipment I would have to give them a deposit of $499. So, for a problem that they caused I would have to pay $79 and be without a TV in my room for up to 2 weeks.'
b"I am very disappointed and frustrated with them. If I could be assured that they would really replace my box with a new one, transfer my lifetime subscription, and have everything work like it did a month ago I'd pay the money but I don't have confidence that this would really happen. I no longer have confidence in TiVo since they don't stand behind their product."

b"I went out and bought a TiVo Bolt and Mini thinking that would be the answer to my frustration with high cable TV prices. I got the hardware installed and signed up for everything online, give them a credit card number for month by month subscription until I decided whether the service was right for me or not. After a few months I realized that it really didn't give me what I needed. I still had to subscribe to Netflix Hulu Amazon in order to give all of the programming that I wanted and TiVo just didn't seem worthwhile."
b"I went online to try to cancel my subscription but after being able to do everything else online discovered that the one thing they won't let you do online have to call and talk to somebody. I tried calling but got frustrated waiting in the queue so gave up. About that time the credit card I was using expired so I decided to simply let the subscription end for non-payment. Now they are billing me for $89 for that nonpayment. When I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay it they turned it over to a collection agency that I am now dealing with. Not to mention a couple hundred dollars of useless equipment. Wish I read the reviews here before getting involved with this awful company!"

b"I have been a long time customer of TiVo. Just recently I started having issues with my TiVo Roamio and its HDMI port. I called tech support and they had me go through all the basic steps, which I understand. My TiVo Roamio was deemed 'defective' and support sent me out a replacement. The replacement box that I received was defective and would hardly boot up before rebooting itself. I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again. They deemed that the replacement box was defective, so they sent me out another box. I received the 2nd replacement box and yes, that too was defective. It wasn't an issue with booting up this time, it booted up but the screen was pixelated to the point where it could hardly be read. I started doubting myself here and tested many different scenarios - different HDMI cables, different TVs, etc - nothing."
b"I called support, they had me go through all the same troubleshooting techniques again (now it's starting to get a little old) - and they deemed this box defective as well. They sent me out another box. Keep track here, this is the 3rd replacement box. This box worked! Was on a brand new (Completely different brand) TV, UPS, top of the line HDMI cable, anything I could think of that would cause an issue like this. After about 45 days - the HDMI stopped working. I called support, I explained the issue, they had me go through all the troubleshooting techniques and they deemed the box was defective. They were just getting ready to setup a replacement and (this would have been the 4th replacement - my 5th TiVo Roamio) and after a brief hold they told me they did not have any record of my support agreement. They must have some record of what has occurred that shows I had a support agreement, right?!"
b"The technical representative was very quick to get me off the line and transfer me to a customer support representative who could look into why I no longer had any record of my support agreement, which don't come cheap if you have ever purchased one. When I finally got to the representative on the phone she saw record of my support agreement and couldn't understand why it was no longer on my account. I was placed on hold, and she came back and said I was no longer eligible to receive replacement boxes. She couldn't explain why - I was asking if I had reached a 'limit of liability' of some sort, but one would think that since I was given essentially 3 faulty replacement boxes that even if there was a liability limit that I would not be subject to that clause. After going back and forth, she said that if I wished, I could extend my warranty for another two years - but I was limited to only ONE replacement box."
b"This is outrageous. Why would I pay even more money for the chance that yet another replacement box would work? I find it completely unacceptable and disappointing that TiVo would not only offer such poor support, send out non-functional replacement boxes under their warranty program, but not even stand behind the fact that I have a contract with them to ensure my box is working. I would drop the company all together if I hadn't paid for the lifetime subscription on the TiVo Roamio, and purchased 4 TiVo Minis to work with it. I have a lot invested in this system that is still covered under warranty, but TiVO will not support. Absolutely unacceptable. Buyers beware."

b"I upgraded a lifetime service agreement on one of my 2 Premier TiVOs to a new Bolt 10 days ago. The sales rep for TiVO, who was NOT located in the USA, transferred the wrong TiVO Premier lifetime service from a machine I still intend to use. Trying to explain this situation to the various foreign representatives has taken at least 20 phone calls to TiVO and, to date, developed 5 different Case Numbers in the past 10 days. I have requested a representative based in the USA to speak to about this issue. The only thing TiVO has done is to close the Cases without ever talking to me, by voice, or email, or pony express for that matter. This company's customer service is a cruel joke."

b'We have now owned three TiVos. The most recent being the BOLT. It has just failed and is less than two years old. TiVo insists the only way to transfer our purchase of a lifetime subscription is if they ship to us a new one and we return the nonfunctional TiVo. This whole transaction will take 5 to 6 days. We are requesting that we go and buy a new one now and then ship back to defective one, but TiVo will NOT accommodate us. We would have to buy another lifetime guarantee. This is not customer service! We have spent hours on the phone with TiVo going round and round about this with zero customer service, little to no understanding of what we are saying. They LOVE to put you on hold forever hoping you will hang up or go away. If you are in the market for inferior equipment, horrific customer service and wasting hours of your time, this is your product!'

b"I purchased a TiVo Bolt. I'm on the road all of the time, so I do not need cable or satellite service. The Bolt works great. The problem is the TiVo Mini's. This is the second one they sent me to fix the problem. It is worse than the first one... The problem is... For those of you who work with computer hardware and software like me. If the wifi card is active and the Ethernet port is also active, they will not be compatible. There is no way to deactivate either one... With so many complaints with this product, you will think they can fix it!!!"

b'My TIVO Bolt worked for 4 months, but has had issues for over 2 months. Calling support results in the same response. "Unplug the unit, Unplug the modem, do this multiple times" while I am put on hold for 5-10 minutes at a time. Then wait 5-10 days and try it again. When asking to speak to a supervisor usually results in a dropped call. The couple of times I got someone, I was again put on hold for 5-10 minutes. I finally got them to send a new unit, which had a different problem.'
b'After going through multiple calls, they finally agreed to take the new unit back and send another unit. Surprise, the new unit had the same issue as the first replacement. Now I am told it is a known issue and to wait another 15-20 days for a fix. I have had 14 different service log numbers and spent over 4 hours on the phone with TIVO. I purchased a one year contract upfront, which I now know was a mistake. I plan to cancel as soon as possible and never deal with TIVO again. I rated them a 1 only because there was no 0 option. I hope this save someone the aggravation of dealing with this company.'

b'TIVO Discontinued My Lifetime Service. What is the point of paying for Lifetime service if TiVo is just going to cancel it whenever they feel like it? I\'m sure there is something in their legal mumbo-jumbo that allows them to do it but they shouldn\'t be able to call it "lifetime" service if it isn\'t. They should call it "lifetime service until we cancel it", at least that would be truth in advertising. Very sad because I have used Tivo for over 10 years and I hate the idea of using another service.'

b"Like many others on this thread, I had excellent service and luck with TiVo. I have two Series 2 boxes which have run for 10+ years with little incidents. If/when there were incidents, I'd call the TiVo Tech Support line and they'd invariably help me fix the problem quickly and professionally. In February, I got an email saying the Series 2 boxes would not be supported much longer. They had a great offer to transfer my lifetime service onto a new Bolt. I bought a Bolt and a TiVo Mini to connect to the machine. I then got emails saying the supply was not meeting demand and the delivery was on hold awaiting their manufacturer. I got the new Bolt a few weeks later and got it all running with the TiVo Mini. I really liked streaming off the box onto my phone feature because I travel for business. "
b"All was working well until a few weeks ago. I spent 10+ hours on phone with TiVo Support and Verizon as TiVo often blames the provider. Then TiVo sent me a replacement box. I got it, plugged it in, called TiVo to activate. It didn't work. Called Verizon. Spent 3+ hours on phone trying to get it to work. Called TiVo back. Spent another 3+ hours. Finally, I plugged my Series3 boxes back in and they work fine. So, after 20+ hours of working on this, I called TiVo and they're refunding my money. It appears these Bolts are just not working."

b"Customer for 9 years. Premiere box in 2008, then Roamio Plus in 2014. Premiere died two years ago (hard drive kaput). Roamio is still alive. The interface for the DVR function is fabulous and the recording function seldom fails. But over the years as streaming and wireless connectivity has taken on a bigger role, Tivo has lagged far behind. During that same timeframe I have owned Apple TV (two boxes) and Amazon box. Never ever an issue with them streaming. Tivo not so much. Once a month Tivo box fails to connect with Tivo's homeland to download the TV listings (without which, Tivo can't record). When that happens, you need to check under the hood and tinker because Tivo support only ever has one solution: reboot your router (then reboot your cable modem then reboot Tivo then start rebooting everything again). "
b"I don't even know the support phone numbers for Apple and Amazon because I have never had to call them. Tivo offers a link to Netflix and Youtube just like Apple. Choosing the Tivo link instead of Apple is madness - freezes up midway through any show. Same top of the line router, same distance from it. And the Tivo smartphone app? HaHaHa..."

b'Purchased three (3) TiVo units that are now 3, 4 and 5 years old respectively - all with lifetime service. Approximately six months ago, the channel guide would not download correctly to all three devices requiring a call into customer support. TiVo acknowledges the problem promising a fix but it has only gotten worse. The temporary fix is to reboot the DVR. After contacting TiVo again for the third time with yet another ticket number, I elected to reach out again by phone.'
b'I first spoke with Muriel who then passed me on to her supervisor, Patrick. In the course of our discussion, Patrick suggested, given the age of my 5 year old unit, that problems are to be expected. I argued, "What therefore, is the value of a Lifetime Service Plan if it is only expected to last 5 years?" Flustered, he proceeded to ramble on with a stream of nonsensical gibberish only to hang up on me.'
b"Patrick's 5 year admission only serves to confirm that TiVo's long term, life time plans are meaningless. Their business model is based on two elements, 1) monthly service fees and 2) selling new hardware. Bear in mind, there's nothing wrong with my hardware - it's a software issue. As a software developer, there's no easier way for a technology company to render a product worthless than by breaking the software with which its hardware is dependent. TiVo does not want their solutions lasting beyond 5 years - consequently, there's no value in purchasing a TiVo."

b"I have had a Tivo DVR since the company's launch. I recently acquired a BOLT after nearly 2 months of fooling around with fixing the #3 generation TIVO. I can't begin to describe the hassle I've encountered -- everything from payment to order to technical support. I suspect that TIVO's recent acquisition by a larger company may have something to do with the problems I've encountered. Now after about 3 weeks of use, the BOLT box I installed isn't working and TIVO is mailing me another. I am ready to pull the plug and use the less user friendly but at least less expensive cable DVR. Don't make an investment in this technology unless you're willing to put up with consistent problems across the board. It's too bad as this used to be a very well run company."

b"Like other reviewers, I upgraded my TiVo box, then found out a year later I was being billed for two TiVos... I guess this is standard rip off for them. Now I'm trying to cancel my account, they won't let me! Ridiculous! I will have to cancel the card they are billing. I don't know how to prove I'm trying to cancel this. It's outright robbery. Beware."

b'I canceled my service two months ago with TiVo after 12 years as a loyal customer. Imagine my surprise when I was billed a couple of days ago for the canceled service. I called today to inquire and was told that the first rep had offered me two months of free service as compensation and since I didn\'t call back to cancel before that time was up, my service was continued and I was billed. Let me be clear, the first rep said he was extending free service so that I could "sell the box" and due to my loyalty. He never once mentioned my having to call back into re-cancel. And now they refuse to refund me for this month. This is very, very poor customer service and TiVo has lost a very loyal customer forever.'

b"When you call the phone number for Tivo, you no longer get a person in the United States. They no longer have any representation here. If you think as an American I am giving my information to total strangers in the Philippines, think again! Tivo has completely gone downhill. Worst company ever. No wonder everyone has billing issues. And they will lie and tell you that no one can talk right now in the States... Do you get this. There is no more USA jobs for Tivo or Tivo support!!! Know how I know, the supervisor in the Philippines told me so!!! Don't buy a Tivo. They are no longer a good company. It is terribly sad. It's all about them getting your $$$."

b'I ordered top of the line Tivo, Tivo Mini and service. Received product and when I connected, I was told it would not work with my equipment or service. I immediately returned $1000.00 worth of equipment and was told I would be refunded within 10 days of them receiving it. It has been 20 days and still no refund. When I try to contact customer service, I am disconnected. I have tried email and they acknowledge receiving the email but offer no resolution. This is INSANE.'

b'TiVo makes it nearly impossible to cancel. They want to bill you forever, even after you\'ve stopped using their service. They let you sign up online, but you can\'t cancel online. I call them and they pretend they can\'t find my account, even though I give them my name and phone number - the info they request and the info my account was registered with. They play games and will probably turn account over to collection agency once it totals a few hundred bucks. The last time I called them to cancel - June 19, 2017 at 14:44, a gal who called herself "Ann" claimed she couldn\'t find my account; refused to give a last name, employee number or any way to really identify her and refused my three requests to speak to a supervisor. BEWARE - CROOKS!'

b'Three months ago I "thought" I was going to "enjoy" Tivo when I discovered the same day of Tivo activation that I had a serious mold issue! Part of the foundation as well as walls and flooring in approximately one third of my home has gone through the long and intricate remediation process of demolition and building! I discovered that my credit card was paying for the monthly Tivo that I had NEVER EVER even had a chance to turn on and watch even a single TV show of any kind!'
b'I called Tivo and asked to have my account suspended as I had this terrible problem! THEY ARE SO GREEDY! No they would not suspend it! They had to cancel for a penalty of 75.00 or I could continue to pay for nothing as well! Very bad customer relation! I think with the loss I have now into this and the BULLY behavior I experienced with this VERY arrogant company that I will just throw this idea away and put it all behind me! I hope anyone who wishes to experience the Tivo service that they research it thoroughly! Very expensive mistake I made in this one sided uncaring company!'

b'When I purchased a new Bolt a year ago, I cancelled service on the old Premiere. I just found out that I have been being charged 14.99 a month for 12 months for that Premiere. Customer support said I never requested cancellation of the Premiere and that I had been carrying two services for the years. They also said they would not refund the money because it had been my responsibility to stop the service.'

b'I want to warn prospective customers that units are expensive, mostly defective and built not to last (tried both Roamio and Bolt). Charged $300 for a TiVo Bolt. Subscription is $14.99/month. Warranty is only for 90 days, after which they try to sell you a "refurbished" unit for an additional cost of $149! Then try to rip customers off further with selling "service agreements". The front green light on my almost 13-month-old Bolt suddenly stopped lighting up. The unit would not respond in any way to the remote. The light on the back was on and I could hear the fan running. I checked online - seems to be a common problem - and went through all the recommended steps, including unplugging the unit, trying to set up again, etc. but nothing worked.'
b'When I called tech support, I was first told that they only offer a 90-day warranty but would send me a "refurbished" unit for a cost of $149. Told them I would not be forced or coerced into paying them AGAIN for a practically new $300 unit. They agreed to send me a \'refreshed?\' unit (with no cords or remote) at no charge. I spent hours transferring my saved programs onto the new unit, with phone help from TiVo. Within a week, the so-called refurbished/refreshed unit started to cut out sound, freeze screen picture and kept losing connectivity with my WiFi (the latter of which was working perfectly with my laptops and printer combo). I then wasted hours on the phone with a variety of tech support and customer service staff. For my "frustration and inconvenience," I was promised a brand new Bolt with attachments. A week later, another "refreshed" unit with no attachments was received.'
b'Since then I have called several times, always maintaining politeness to reps in both tech support and customer service. I was assured that my case would be escalated to a supervisor and promised a call within 3 days - which never came. I called again May 8th, was disconnected several times, even when "escalated" to a supervisor twice (with no call back, despite them verifying my phone number on my account). Bottom line, they sell you an expensive product, charge you a monthly subscription fee, and don\'t give a damn about selling a lasting product or customer service.'
b'I am not writing this to be vindictive, but to warn others not to get sucked into this giant scam. Yes, it\'s a good service - WHEN IT WORKS! Do NOT trust a "refreshed" unit - both a replacement Roamio and Bolt were defective from the start. They also make every effort to get customers to pay another 50% of the cost of a new unit that was only purchased 13 months prior.'

After a month of not programming properly and TIVO not answering any questions about their problems they finally sent out an email saying the problem was fixed. After doing all they asked we find out they messed up yet again. I would like to know if they are ever going to get this problem with recording one passes. We are so very disappointed in them.'

b'Today, my TiVo Mini just refuse to work. It was working fine yesterday, but today, nope. I tried to do some troubleshooting myself, but it would not work. I called tech support and, after about 30 minutes of unplugging everything, etc., etc., the tech guy said I had to replace the Mini. I believe it is barely more than one year old. So, I have to pay $79 to get another one, but they will not send it out until I Fedex them the broken one. So, this process will take about a week during which time, obviously, no TV service in the main room of the house.'
b'With what they charge for their equipment and service fees, I expect a better quality product. Or, if something happens, I expect them to make it work ASAP and not wait until I find a box to mail them a faulty piece of equipment. I could use the box the replacement is coming in - IF I COULD GET IT. And, as a further insult, TiVo has already charged my credit card for the full amount of the replacement - which is not being sent to me. I will never recommend TiVo to anyone and am considering getting another service, myself.'

b'I have had a TIVO Roamio for a couple of years and have really enjoyed it. I decided to purchase a TIVO Bolt. I started the activation process and found out that I would be committed to paying the monthly price regardless of whether or not I used it. It is absolutely ridiculous that you must purchase their hardware (which would be useless without a subscription), and then be held to pay on a monthly basis regardless of use. I wonder if Donald Trump owns a share of this company. It\'s something he would do to take advantage of people with limited income. I told the "advanced" customer service representative that I did not agree with the terms and he hung up on me. '
b"I am returning the TIVO Bolt to Best Buy (letting them know why they need to take the device back) and I am going to find out if I will be committed to a year subscription for the Roamio I currently have when the current year expires. If so, I'm done with that. If more customers refused to be held hostage, TIVO would get a clue and treat us with some respect."

Although this is a known problem with TiVos they act like I'm the only one that has ever had this problem, which is completely untrue. They should not sell a product that they cannot honestly support. Really too bad, this used to be a great company. Unfortunately, not anymore."

b"I have no idea how far to go with the horrid support. I have been a Tivo owner since 2004 and simplicity has been the reason... That is gone. I literally lost 2-3 weeks of my life due to a defective unit. Not only did it not work until it was replaced over two weeks later (I requested it be replaced right away) but they insisted to be patient and keep downloading updates even though as long as it was hooked up I couldn't use my tv at all... Two weeks of no tv and missed shows and spending most of my time forcing updates or calling and playing games is absurd. My time is valuable and obviously tivo doesn't seem to care. I even got one support agent talking down to me and literally gaslighting me. No one should get that from tech support."
b"The only reason I even got a replacement was because after the abuse I Insisted on talking to a manager as my desire to return it was ignored. He sent one out asap. I asked about a previous unit that was supposed to come to me a week earlier and it was never sent even though support kept claiming it was on its way. They also kept insisting a new unit wouldn't fix the problem even though a new unit worked perfectly out of the box. I lost weeks worth of functionality, time and stress I didn't need."
b"It's not too much to ask a company to respect your time is valuable. My time lost could have bought 10 bolts... this refurbished one... which I only bought due to the discounted price wasn't worth it. It's working fine now but I feel compromised keeping it. I just don't want to fight with them anymore. When it expires I highly doubt I will ever use tivo again. If you get the runaround DON'T play their game. Insist on returning it or getting a new one ASAP and insist if it doesn't arrive in time to take it back. Although I doubt they will. You'd think they respect your desire to return things but I can't force them to live up to their legal responsibility without a lawyer."

b'Bottom Line'
b'The Bolt+ is an upgraded DVR for TiVo power users who want 4K support, six tuners, hundreds of hours of recording time, and are willing to pay a high price for it.'

b'The Good'
b'The TiVo Bolt combines a best-in-class DVR experience with a streaming media box; it has the capability to stream and download recorded content to iOS and Android devices; and easy expansion to other rooms with TiVo Mini extenders; skip commercials on primetime TV recordings with a single button press; excellent cross-service search.'
b'\n'
b'The Bad'
b'The still-required monthly or "lifetime" service fees raise the total cost of ownership; though the app selection is very good, you still may need another streaming-media box to fill in the gaps; doesn\'t work with satellite or AT&T U-verse.'
b'\n'
b'The Bottom Line'
b'The TiVo Bolt makes a strong claim to the throne as king of DVRs and streaming media, but those pesky TiVo service fees keep it short of perfection.'

b"TiVo has been in the DVR game for the better part of two decades, and even in the slow-paced TV world, that's enough time to see lots of change. Surprisingly, with the "
b'oldest competitors '
b". The company seems to have realized it's not just trying to beat your cable or satellite company's half-assed excuse for a set-top box, as Apple, Google, Roku, Amazon and others join game systems and Blu-ray players in a fight for living room dominance. Now, TiVo has a new design and, for the first time, a solution for easily skipping commercials. Still, that might not be enough to make the Bolt (starting at $300) a good buy."

b'Summary'
b'\n'
b"The Bolt isn't for cord-cutters, or power TiVo users who value Lifetime service or need more recording space and tuners. But for the casual TV viewer who just wants a better cable box without making a huge upfront investment? Even with an interestingly curved frame, it's a perfect fit -- all while piling on extras like commercial skipping and sending recordings to your phones and tablets."

b'Hardware'
b"You can check out our preview for most of our impressions of the hardware, which continued to hold up under further use. The Bolt's bent shape means you won't be stacking anything on it, but it's so much smaller than the TiVos of old, we don't think most people will have a problem fitting it in their cabinets somehow. In my living room it was virtually silent, and you can turn off the lights on the front, as on previous models. It's missing analog video/audio outputs, but that's about all you'll have to give up for the size of this relatively diminutive DVR."
b'Inside, TiVo has switched to a 2.5-inch hard drive, which some owners have already taken a shot at '
b'swapping out'
b'WeaKnees is selling units with 2TB drives'
b"about the bottom-mounted fan (positioned where the box is curved so it can get some air) being too loud. If it's in a spot that can provide vibrations or echoes, it could be much louder than other DVRs, since there's less space for the air to flow through."
b"Judging by the style of TiVo's refreshed logo, the Bolt's arc shape is something fans will need to get used to, at least for certain units. I like it, but for many it's disconcerting at best, and annoyingly incompatible with stacking at worst. I'd be shocked to see if the new "
b'Pro-level DVR expected next year'
b'Software'
b"The software has been revamped, but with a light touch -- it's still TiVo. A new style with flatter icons and channel logos gives it a more modern look, but if you already liked the UI, it's not a big change. I'm not sure if it's the new hardware inside the Bolt or a switch from Flash to HTML5 for apps, but the new box is definitely better equipped to page through Amazon and Netflix than its predecessors. Still, that's not quite enough to make this style of DVR a direct competitor for the likes of Apple, Roku and Amazon. The basic TiVo interface has had so many things added to it over the years, that it still feels like you're taking extra clicks to get into and out of apps, set up new OnePass recordings or even just browse through the guide. The number of features the Bolt offers is definitely better than competing TV boxes that are stuck pushing just internet TV or cable TV, but the trade-off there is a more complicated UI."
b"I talked about the ad-skipping and sped-up QuickMode viewing in the preview, and most of that still applies. After using it for a few weeks, I was a bit surprised to find that my favorite thing about SkipMode is using it to jump to the beginning of a show. Usually there's a few seconds of whatever was already on at the beginning of a recording (more if I'm padding it with an early start time) and on SkipMode-enabled recordings, hitting the green button immediately takes you to the start, no fiddling or fast-forwarding-then-rewinding required. It's a tiny thing, but I've come to love it. I also noticed rare occasions where the SkipMode failed to appear, although it's not clear why -- it's not enough to be particularly troubling, but if you're buying a box for this feature, you would expect it to work all the time."
b'This is your TiVo app on the Fire TV. No guide or flashy UI, just a bare-bones list of recordings.'
b'A new feature that applies to the whole TiVo family (with streaming abilities) is the option to watch recordings from a non-TiVo set-top box: the Amazon Fire TV. It\'s something some have already been doing by hacking the app, but now it\'s official. I loaded up the (still "beta") app '
b'Roamio predecessors'
b") comes with the ability to sling video around your house. At launch, it's not ready for streaming when you're away from home -- that's coming in a future software update."
b'Doing the math'
b"Where TiVo is losing some of its diehards however, isn't the software -- it's the cost. Fretting over the price of Lifetime "
b'and whether or not it will go away for good'
b': One year of TiVo service (necessary to actually use the box) is included right off the bat. That\'s great, but adding "Lifetime" service, which keeps the box active for as long as it\'s working, and can transfer if you sell it in the future, now costs $600, up from $400. Combined with the base model Bolt, that\'s $900 spent before you\'ve even added a Mini extender or extra storage, and for now there\'s no rebate for existing customers. If that\'s too big of a commitment, TiVo offers a one-year plan for $150 and ('
b'under certain conditions'
b') a monthly plan for $15.'
b"There's no question that this makes for a pricier upgrade than usual, and it also means that the difference between buying Lifetime and going with a year-to-year plan puts your break-even point (considering the year of service included and assuming prices stay the same) at five years clear of the original purchase. That's a long time to be tethered to a TiVo, although it does enhance resale value if you ever decide to move on. Clearly, TiVo is trying to quietly push customers to its year-to-year service plan, and on its face, it may simplify the pricing for newbies to the ecosystem. Diving into a TiVo setup with Lifetime service was always an expensive proposition, and with that decision largely pushed off by the new pricing, now you will only compare it to the cost of renting a (likely inferior) DVR from a cable or satellite company."
b"Compared to a cable DVR, I currently pay $26 per month (total, $10 for the DVR and $8 each for two extenders) to rent Comcast's X1 setup. After 24 months that's $624, so even just a couple of years of TiVo ($300 for a 500GB Bolt + $300 for two Minis + $150 for an extra year of service = $750) can be a comparable decision compared to cable, for a better experience that doesn't reboot every night at 3AM. After three years, it's $936 for cable vs. $900 for TiVo on that plan, although it could take longer for the price advantage to flip if one opts for Lifetime service."

b'What is the TiVo Bolt?'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The set-top box market has become increasingly competitive with the likes of '
b'Roku'
b', '
b'Apple TV'
b'\n'
b'To add to consumer confusion, there are cable and satellite boxes, as well as DVR replacements. The options are seemingly endless, and trying to determine which solution best fits your needs is tough.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt, however, attempts to be the set-top box that can fulfil most of your requirements. It comes with the streaming applications you\xe2\x80\x99d would find in other set-top boxes, but adds the ability to watch live TV, record shows, and even skip adverts. '
b'\n'
b'It also has smartphone integration, which should appeal to households that are committed to the world of cable but looking to break away from the living room. The TiVo Bolt is currently only available in the US and only works with US cable providers.'

b'TiVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Design & Features'
b'\n'
b'Although notably smaller than previous TiVo devices, it remains substantially larger than recent set-top boxes such as Apple TV or Roku 4. Worse, its banana-like shape means you have no choice about where you place it in your media centre if you stack devices on top of one another, which is just plain awkward.'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt is available with either 500GB or 1TB of hard disk storage. I tested the 1TB version, which is enough to store around 150 hours of full HD video.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'As with previous TiVos, the TiVo Bolt requires a CableCard, which your cable company should be able to supply. Some companies may charge you a monthly fee for this, however, so it\xe2\x80\x99s worth finding out before you take the plunge. The set-top box also supports an HD aerial for those who want to watch broadcast TV.'

b'The Bolt has both Wi-Fi connectivity and a gigabit Ethernet port. The 802.11ac, dual-band Wi-Fi is particularly impressive: despite sitting in my basement, the Bolt easily connected to a router two floors up and delivered a consistent and reliable connection.'
b'\n'
b'The obligatory HDMI port supports the latest HDMI 2.0, Ultra HD-compatible standard making it future-proof even if your current TV does not support Ultra HD content. You also get two USB2 ports and an eSATA port for hooking up external storage, which acts as an overflow for the internal disk.'
b'\n'
b'The Bolt comes with a wide range of streaming apps, including the familiar options you would expect, such as Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu and YouTube.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Setup'
b'\n'
b'Setup takes some time, however, so block out an afternoon to make sure you can get everything up and running. The device ships with an HDMI cable, so I was able to quickly plug that into my TV, hook it up to my cable connection through its coax port, and flick it on. Once the Bolt powered on, it was the start of a set-up process that took close to an hour.'

b'The TiVo Bolt needs to calibrate on several fronts just to get to a television connection. After I spent the time plugging the device into my other hardware, I had to provide location information, connect it to my wireless network, and follow the many on-screen prompts to get going. While those prompts were helpful and easy to follow it was still a laborious experience. The Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s remote may work well for a viewing experience, but for tapping around a menu, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pain. Hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll only have to do this once so the pain will be short lived.'
b'\n'
b'There are two ways to get started with the TiVo: via over-the-air broadcasts, which is the quicker option, or by getting a CableCard from a service provider and watching TV through their offering. Since I already had CableCards handy, I opted for the latter. '
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The biggest issue with TiVo is that you\xe2\x80\x99re required to pay a monthly service fee. While the Bolt comes with one year free, once that period ends you will need to pay $149.99 per year or $14.99 per month just to keep the TiVo service running. '
b'\n'
b'The other consideration is that some service providers require that TiVo owners add a tuning adapter, called a switched digital video adapter, to the device. While connecting that adapter takes some manoeuvring of cables, it proved annoying to have to use it. It\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps also worth noting that on-demand channels and other features one would find from their standard cable box may be unavailable, adding another wrinkle.'
b'\n'
b'Service and setup present some issues that TiVo \xe2\x80\x93 at least right now \xe2\x80\x93 can\xe2\x80\x99t address. And for many, the hassle of the extra adapter and monthly fee will be enough to make them look elsewhere.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'TiVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Remote, Interface and Experience'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt comes with the familiar peanut-shaped TiVo remote, although this one has been redesigned somewhat from the TiVos of old. While it is small, it\xe2\x80\x99s still comfortable to hold and both children and adults should have no problems using it.'
b'\n'
b'As with previous models, the remote has a TiVo button at the top, as well as easy access to critical features, such as the Guide, play, pause, and navigation. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s thumbs-up and thumbs-down feature for refining your tastes is also available, providing old-time TiVo owners with some familiarity.'
b'\n'
b'The remote itself is well designed and I had no issue learning quickly where the buttons were placed and how to move my fingers around to find the features I wanted. As far as DVRs go, TiVo is still offering the finest remote on the market.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo is similarly top-notch when it comes to user interface design. The company has polished the interface a little, but it still delivers an enjoyable, familiar experience that makes it easy to find programming, search for shows, and flip through menus.'
b'\n'
b'It includes a feature called OnePass (a service that replaced the former Season Pass), which automatically finds and records shows across both live TV and online streaming services. For example, fans of the show Gotham can enter their account information for services such as Amazon Instant and Netflix and OnePass will pull in the series\xe2\x80\x99 shows from all of those as well as your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s own on-demand service (if available) and put them into one easy-to-access place. OnePass is intelligent and convenient, and made both starting new shows and catching up on others simple and elegant.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Arguably its most intriguing feature, however, is the ability to skip adverts. SkipMode, which becomes available after a show has been recorded, provides an alert to let you know adverts are incoming. I simply pushed a button on the remote, and I was back to my show without having caught sight of an ad. '
b'\n'
b'There are some caveats that govern the SkipMode\xe2\x80\x99s use. For one, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available for programmes that run from 4pm until midnight. In addition, it only works on around 20 channels. However, TiVo is expected to expand its partnership with other networks in the future to offer the SkipMode to more channels.'
b'\n'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also QuickMode, which I used to skip through parts of a reality show at increased speed while still being able to listen to the audio. It\xe2\x80\x99s particularly useful for catching up on sports events and speech-heavy content as well as shows that perhaps don\xe2\x80\x99t engage your full concentration. The device also comes with the ability to connect to an Android or iOS device, and either download or mirror content to those devices.'
b'\n'
b'As someone who\xe2\x80\x99s been locked in a world of cable for years, not having quick and easy access to on-demand channels was a pain. Granted, streaming apps have made this a little easier to swallow, but TiVo has several gaps in that area that need to be addressed before it can become a full replacement for heavy TV watchers. '
b'\n'
b'With all of that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find fault in the overall TiVo Bolt experience. Moving around the software was simple and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t succumb to any annoying glitches. The device was able to render the features quickly, its 4K support is a welcome addition, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s own features, such as suggestions and wish list, are still among my favourite for finding new shows. '
b'\n'
b'TiVo Bolt \xe2\x80\x93 Should I buy the TiVo Bolt?'
b'\n'
b'Those in the market for a new set-top box to upgrade their TV experience need to weigh up the pros and cons of switching to TiVo. They need to decide how many services are available, how much value they\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of the device, and crucially, the total cost of ownership. Ultimately it depends on your own viewing habits and the services your cable provider already offers.'
b'\n'
b'For those looking for a DVR experience and want some of the extras that are offered in streaming boxes, the TiVo Bolt delivers. Those who want a wider array of streaming services and don\xe2\x80\x99t care about what\xe2\x80\x99s on TV at any given time, however, will find that the TiVo Bolt falls short.'
b'\n'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also the issue of cost. The TiVo Bolt costs $300 for the 500GB model and $400 for the 1TB option. While that cost includes one year of TiVo service, after that, the TiVo-exclusive features \xe2\x80\x93 including SkipMode, QuickMode, OnePass, and others \xe2\x80\x93 come at a cost of $14.99 per month or $149.99 per year. Add that to the standard cost of cable television and the monthly fees charged by streaming services, and the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s total cost of ownership starts to soar.'
b'\n'
b'Verdict'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'At $300 or $400, the TiVo Bolt may be one of the more expensive set-top boxes on the market, but it also delivers one of the richest and most appealing experiences. Despite its unorthodox design, the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding software, unique features, good performance and plenty of add-ons make it a worthy buy.'

b'TiVo Bolt: Hands-on Review'
b'\nPosted on '

b'In a perfect world, everyone would have TiVo. Gone would be the hours of frustration spent while you railed at your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR that had managed, '
b'yet again'
b', to miss recording '
b'The\xc2\xa0Amazing Race'
b', because the late-Sunday Packer\xe2\x80\x99s game went into overtime and, God-forbid CBS ever just '
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'60 Minutes'
b', and you knew this would happen; but the only options your dumb box gave you were \xe2\x80\x9cRecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCancel\xe2\x80\x9d so you had to just trust that it would '
b'somehow'
b"\xc2\xa0know that it needed to timeshift things when the schedule got all f'(ootball)ed-up."
b'\n'
b'Sucker.'

b'But the hardware is secondary to the amazing software package you get with the TiVo Bolt. After living with it for a few weeks, I would find it practically impossible to go back to anything but the Bolt. For those of you on an older TiVo box, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice right away that the interface has been cleaned up considerably, with a Live TV window in the corner and suggested shows running along the top. The menus are responsive and all settings are much more accessible than in previous versions of the OS. What\xe2\x80\x99s particularly noteworthy is OnePass. The outdated Season Pass feature is gone. I loved it because it let me catch every episode of a show, no matter when or where it aired. But inevitably I would miss an ep and be stuck rifling through Netflix or sifting through VuDu or Amazon. OnePass takes those two paradigms, recording live television and streaming video, and mashes them together. Now, I can see a listing of all the seasons and episodes of a OnePass show, along with\xc2\xa0where I can get them from. VuDu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime are currently supported on the Bolt (Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry! HuluPlus is coming too!). This was an absolute life saver when I managed to delete the only\xc2\xa0'
b'Wild Kratts'
b'\xc2\xa0show that daughter was interested in watching.'
b'\n'
b'QuickMode is an essential feature on Sunday at my house. My son is a consummate football geek. He wants to listen to every second of commentary and pore over every replay. Me? I just want them to snap the ball already. Usually this meant I would fast forward through all the cruft between plays, right up to the snap, allowing me to watch the game in a fraction of the time. After all, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two kids and the schedule to match, fitting in three hours of football is an unheard of luxury. QuickMode lets us both get what we want \xe2\x80\x93 it speeds up the playback to 30% of normal, which is just enough to considerably compress the time it takes to watch a game; but still leave all the commentators intelligible \xc2\xa0(well, as intelligible as they ever were\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s not a '
b'magic '
b'hilarious'
b'\xc2\xa0to watch.'
b'\n'
b'SkipMode is the Holy Grail feature for the Bolt. Having used TiVo for the past decade, I have a deep-seated dislike\xc2\xa0of commercials. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how being able to fast forward past them practically whenever you watch a show considerably lessens your tolerance. In fact both of my children, when confronted with live television for the first time, were gobsmacked when I explained to them that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just fast forward past the commercials to get back to their shows. The Roamio introduced a dedicated 30-second skip button, which made jumping past commercial breaks a matter of a couple of presses (and some guessing). The Bolt retains that button; but adds the ability to skip past the commercials entirely with a single press. SkipMode is\xc2\xa0the closest thing you can get to a streaming video experience for recorded television and it\xe2\x80\x99s glorious. It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten so I practically refuse to watch anything live anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather wait the hour or so for SkipMode to be enabled for the show. It\xe2\x80\x99s available on nearly every Prime Time show and its commercial-free nirvana. My only wish is that this feature could be enabled across the entire TiVo line (and on\xc2\xa0'
b'\xc2\xa0show)\xc2\xa0so that I could use it on my Mini.'
b'\n'
b'The elephant in the room is that the Bolt requires you to sign up for a service package (or buy a lifetime subscription for the unit). However, it does comes with a free year of service \xe2\x80\x93 so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to decide if the greatest DVR ever is worth the $150 a year (They do offer a monthly plan, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not offered up front and it\xe2\x80\x99s $15 a month, which is kind of a \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d after a year of free service). The nice thing is that you can recoup some\xc2\xa0of those costs by turning in your cable-provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR and renting\xc2\xa0a CableCard from them instead. In the end, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a far superior experience for less cash per month.'
b'\n'
b'Currently, the '
b'Bolt will run you around $300-400'
b', depending on the capacity you choose. My advice? Spring for the more expensive 1TB model, get a TiVo Mini for your other TVs, and let the Bolt be the media streaming device for the whole house.\xc2\xa0Speaking of, there are huge streaming plans in the works for the Bolt. Currently, you can stream your recorded shows in-house to your phones and tablets. But the addition of out-of-home streaming is coming, which means you can get anything your Bolt can access\xc2\xa0'
b'anywhere'
b'.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'I was a big fan of the software refresh that came out for the Roamio last year and figured the Roamio would be the last TiVo I bought for a long time. When the Bolt was first announced, I was skeptical that TiVo could do much more to improve upon their model. I have happily been proven wrong. If you watch TV, you need a Bolt. it\xe2\x80\x99s that simple.'

b'I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of lousy cable/Fioptics DVRs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at buying a Bolt since it came out. But I want aa remote Mini with it, and realized that it requires a hardwire network connection, NOT wireless. That\xe2\x80\x99s not possible for me.'

b'Reading further, you can use coax to set up a network \xe2\x80\x93 MoCA. The Bolt can create such a network, but the Bolt must be hardwired into the router \xe2\x80\x93 also not possible for me. You can buy a $50 MoCA to define network\xe2\x80\xa6'
b'\n'
b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s not simple, unfortunately, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made the investment yet.'

b'I can appreciate that. Setting up the MoCA network over coax was the part that gave me the most trouble. Of course, that was due as much to my poor networking skills as anything else.'

b'Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo has no commercial-skipping button\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\'t make good business sense."'
b'\n'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.'
b'\n'
b'And the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. \xe2\x80\x9cSkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant,\xe2\x80\x9d TiVo now boasts.'
b'\n'

b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Welcome to '
b'Mossberg'
b', a new weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and  Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.'
b'\n'
b'In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.'
b'\n'
b'The latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock".'
b'\n'
b'Still, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Is that thing really a TiVo?'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.'
b'\n'
b'Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 Gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.'
b'\n'
b'But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit Ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)'
b'\n'
b'Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.'
b'\n'
b'To make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.'
b'\n'
b'Um, there are some limitations'
b'\n'
b'So what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?'
b'\n'
b'Well, for one thing it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.'
b'\n'
b'It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."'
b'\n'
b'Still, I loved using the feature.'

b'One box to rule them all?'
b'\n'
b"One of the most important features of the Bolt isn't new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku."
b'\n'
b'For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.'
b'\n'
b'Now, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".'
b'\n'
b'Not only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.'
b'\n'
b'In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.'
b'\n'
b'And, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.'
b'\n'
b'In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it?'
b'\n'
b'Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.'
b'\n'
b'Also, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.'
b'\n'
b'While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.'
b'\n'
b'Bottom line'
b'\n'
b'I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.'
b'\n'
b'But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.'
b'\n'
b'Sure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.'
b'\n'
b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.'

b'TiVo has been facing some stiff competition in the form of cable and satellite company-provided '
b"\xc2\xa0and streaming video services like Hulu, making\xc2\xa0its subscription plan and expensive hardware look less and less appealing. The Bolt could be the DVR that puts TiVo back on top. At $299.99 for a 500GB model and $399.99 for a 1TB version, it's still a relatively pricey device, but it's more affordable than the previous generation of TiVos, and comes with a year of service included, so you don't need to commit to a monthly fee in the first year. Add four tuners, robust content management, out-of-the-home streaming of recordings and live television, and an easy-to-use (albeit text-heavy) interface, and you have a very compelling\xc2\xa0DVR that works with both cable and over-the-air (OTA) television. It's our new Editors' Choice for digital video recorders."

b'Design'
b'The TiVo Bolt'
b"\xc2\xa0is almost Apple-like in design: simple, white, and curved. It looks like a slightly warped box that lifts off of the ground half an inch in a gentle slope on the left side. The front bears a black TiVo logo at the top of the curve, and a small green power LED on the right side of the panel. The back holds an HDMI port, a coaxial cable/antenna connector, an Ethernet port, two USB ports, an eSATA connector for adding storage, 3.5mm and optical audio outputs, the power connector, and a Remote Finder button that makes the remote beep audibly. The CableCARD slot hides behind the Bolt's casing, on the underside of the device. "

b'The remote is a large, curved dog bone of a wand, with a white top panel and black underside. It has two large circular pads: one with directions around a Select button for menu navigation, and one with playback controls around a Pause button. They feel very similar under the thumb, which can make navigating menus in the dark a bit awkward. The remote also has a number pad, four color buttons, and a set of TV controls, including a separate TV Power button.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Service and Setup'
b"As mentioned above, the Bolt comes with one free year of TiVo service. After that, it costs $149.99 per year or $14.99 per month. If you want to use the Bolt with your cable or FiOS service, you're going to need a CableCARD from your service provider. However, the Bolt can also work with OTA broadcasts, which is how we configured it in our test lab. Satellite service is not supported."
b'\n'
b'Setting up the Bolt was simple, but tedious. Connecting everything and telling the device information like geographical location and Wi-Fi network was very straightforward and guided by on-screen prompts. However, getting the Bolt to the point where it could actually show television took over an hour of preparing, setting up, and downloading all of the data it needed to function.'
b'\n'
b'Once everything was up running, the Bolt functioned smoothly. All available OTA channels appeared in the live program guide, and information about current and upcoming shows was aggregated across the various menus. Search results and apps were also responsive.'
b'\n'
b'Interface'
b"TiVo has tweaked and polished its interface over the years, but it remains very text-heavy compared with most streaming media devices. The menu system is built around lists of easy-to-read text choices, with graphics like show logos appearing in the periphery or a few menu levels down from the main screen. It's very easy to navigate, and leaves little ambiguity in menu choices. Whatever screen you're on in the interface, the top right corner will show the current live television feed or recording, letting you keep an eye on what you are\xc2\xa0watching."
b'\n'
b'With everything set up, I started to populate the TiVo recording schedule. The classic Season Pass feature has been replaced by OnePass, which collects episodes of your favorite shows across both live television and online services. I added new episodes of\xc2\xa0'
b'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'
b', '
b"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."
b', '
b'The Flash'
b', and any and all episodes of '
b'The Simpsons'
b'\n'
b"By default, the Bolt shows its own unique Live Guide when you press the Guide button rather than a conventional grid-based guide. However,\xc2\xa0the Live Guide\xc2\xa0is fairly functional, and you can switch the view to a grid guide in a settings menu. It displays a list of available channels and what is currently playing on each on the left side of the screen. The right side displays what will be on the currently selected channel in the near future. Browsing through channels instantly updates this list to show upcoming programming. It doesn't offer as much information on-screen at a given time as a grid display, but it's a bit simpler to navigate."
b'\n'
b"Besides live television from cable, FiOS, or OTA, the Bolt can access streaming television and movies from a handful of sources. It supports Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, YouTube, Plex, Vudu, and AOL On, plus streaming music through Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio. Once you've signed in to your respective accounts for the different services on the Bolt, your search results and OnePass information expands to include those services. With "
b"Marvel's Agents of"
b'\n'
b"The TiVo Central menu displays a rotating selection of four shows or movies on the top of the screen, highlighting what's already in OnePass, upcoming live television, and new content available on demand. From the main screen you can look up your OnePass recordings and streaming content under My Shows; see what is currently on live television under What to Watch Now; search for content or browse lists, collections, and streaming video services under Find TV, Movies & Videos; and check your OnePass settings and both upcoming and previous recordings under Manage Recordings & OnePass."
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The vast majority of what you want to watch can be found under the aforementioned headings, but two separate sections, Music & Photos and Apps & Games, offer additional options for content. Music & Photos currently only includes music apps and Plex. Apps & Games offers full access to the Opera TV Store and its app ecosystem, but using it was sluggish and apps were slow to load.'
b'\n'
b'Modes and 4K'
b"The TiVo Bolt offers two handy features to make watching your favorite shows faster: QuickMode and SkipMode. SkipMode lets you automatically jump to the end of a commercial break by pressing the green button on the remote. However, it only works on certain shows, most of which are prime time network programming. You can't skip commercial breaks on the vast majority of content."
b'\n'
b"QuickMode speeds up recordings by 30 percent and pitch-corrects the audio to make dialogue sound natural. This works with anything you record, and it's very effective. Be wary when watching actors who naturally speak quickly, though; it's easy to miss lines when already fast dialogue is sped up by nearly a third. Still, it's a great way to quickly catch up on a backlog of recordings without missing out on anything important."
b'\n'
b'The Bolt also supports ultra high-definition\xc2\xa0'
b'(UHD, or 4K)'
b"\xc2\xa0video output, though you won't find this to be very useful with your cable or OTA television yet. Currently, UHD video isn't broadcast in any way over the air or through cable services. However, you can watch 4K content on Netflix and Amazon Video through the Bolt. I loaded episodes of\xc2\xa0"
b'Daredevil'
b'\xc2\xa0on Netflix and\xc2\xa0'
b'Bosch'
b'\xc2\xa0on Amazon Video, and both displayed in UHD on 4K television.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo also includes all of the useful features introduced with the '
b'Roamio Pro'
b'. You can remotely control the Bolt with the free TiVo remote app for Android and iOS. More importantly, you\xc2\xa0can stream your OnePass recordings and live television to mobile devices and Web browsers. The Bolt also supports multi-room television setups with optional '
b'TiVo Mini'
b'\xc2\xa0expansion boxes. One\xc2\xa0weakness: relatively limited\xc2\xa0storage space when compared with the 3TB Roamio Pro.\xc2\xa0'
b'\n'
b'Conclusions'
b"If you're not completely committed to keeping cable/OTA, you can save a solid chunk of cash with a non-DVR, tuner-free\xc2\xa0"
b'media streamer'
b"\xc2\xa0like the Editors' Choice "
b'Amazon Fire TV'
b". Of course, we haven't quite reached the point where\xc2\xa0"
b'\xc2\xa0is available to stream the day after it airs, so compromises have to be made depending on the shows you want to watch.'
b'\n'
b"The TiVo Bolt doesn't force you to compromise, and offers the best (and one of the most economical) TiVo experiences yet. It's still a bit pricey at $300 for 500GB of storage, but an eSATA drive can fix that, and the included year of TiVo service really softens the blow (though you'll have to pay for a TiVo subscription after that as long as you use the Bolt). It handles both cable and OTA, and incorporates several major streaming video services seamlessly into its interface. It's easy to use, and powerful enough to serve as your main media hub for both live television and streaming content, making it our Editors' Choice for DVRs."

b'\n'

b'\n'

b'\n'
b'Amazon announced a '
b'4K Fire TV'
b', and rumors are swirling that a 4K Roku\xc2\xa0is days away from announcement. It seems clear that 4K UHD support is the next big thing for streaming set-top boxes (unless, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99re Apple TV). Now you can add TiVo to that list of supporters with the introduction of the new TiVo Bolt Unified Entertainment System.'
b'\n'
b'Dressed in a Storm Trooper-White chassis that is both sleeker and more compact than TiVo DVRs of the past, the Bolt aims to redefine what people think of when they think TiVo.'
b'\n'
b'SkipMode is the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial).'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Aptly described by the company as a \xe2\x80\x9cUnified Entertainment System\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a DVR, the 4-tuner Bolt carries on the tradition '
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Roamio'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Buy now from:'
b'\n'
b'Amazon'
b'Best Buy'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The bottom line: With a boatload of fun new features, 4K UHD streaming apps, and the best content-searching system available, the TiVo Bolt is in prime position to take over as your home entertainment hub.'
b'\n'
b'Out of the box'
b'\n'
b'When it comes to set-top design, big black boxes are out and significantly smaller black boxes are in. Even cable companies stuck in the last century have managed to shrink down the size of their cable boxes. Anyway, TiVo needed a new look, and the Bolt supplies this in a bold way. The new chassis is bright white, the on-board buttons are gone, and the lights have been integrated. The box is also much smaller than TiVo units of the past \xe2\x80\x93 33 percent smaller than the Roamio and 65 percent smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro, according to TiVo. And then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s strange arch in the middle \xe2\x80\x93 this is likely more of a utility feature than an aesthetic choice, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that later.'

b'Surprisingly, TiVo still uses a mechanical hard drive here (likely to keep costs down). The new Bolt is available in a 500GB model for $300 and a 1,000GB (that\xe2\x80\x99s 1 TB to everyone else) goes for $400. One year of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service (normally $150 per year) is included with each. \t\t\t'

b'Connectivity and Features'
b'\n'
b'Not much is new in terms of connectivity for the TiVo Bolt. The most notable change is the inclusion of an HDMI 2.0a compliant output for the latest 4K UHD support. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also find two USB 2.0 ports and an eSATA port for external storage.'

b'An Ethernet port provides a hard-lined connection to the Internet, which we recommend for 4K UHD content streaming, though a built-in Wi-Fi adapter is available (which won\xe2\x80\x99t work with the TiVo mini, by the way). For those with neither of the aforementioned network options, the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial cable connector does support MoCA for Internet over a cable connection \xe2\x80\x94 separate MoCA adapter required. Inside the Bolt is a 4-tuner DVR capable of recording \xe2\x80\xa6 you guessed it, four shows at a time.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo also placed the box\xe2\x80\x99s CableCARD slot underneath the unit, behind a small panel.'
b'\n'
b'On the feature front, however, plenty is new. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the breakdown:'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'SkipMode \xe2\x80\x93 Perhaps the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial), SkipMode takes TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ad-avoidance capabilities to the next level. Rather than force users to press a skip button several times during commercial breaks, SkipMode removes them automatically at the press of a single button. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the catch, though: SkipMode works only with certain primetime and late night TV shows, and only after they have been completely recorded \xe2\x80\x93 it won\xe2\x80\x99t work if you start watching while the recording is in progress. Still, this new feature gives users an extremely powerful tool for cruising through their favorite programs, requiring minimal effort to avoid long-running ads along the way.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'QuikMode \xe2\x80\x93 This feature allows the user to get through long-running programs a little bit faster. Similar to the speeding up of syndicated content that certain networks employ in order to cram in more ads, QuickMode speeds up the show by 30 percent (1.3 times the standard play rate) but without raising the pitch of the sound. For example, you could cruise through a 3-hour sports broadcast in just 2 hours and 6 minutes, but the game announcers won\xe2\x80\x99t sound like chipmunks \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99ll just sound like auctioneers.'

b'\n'
b'\n'
b'4K UHD Apps \xe2\x80\x93 Though we\xe2\x80\x99re a little disappointed that 4K UHD app support is a bit scant at launch, the Bolt will support 4K UHD streams from Netflix and YouTube right away. Support for Amazon, Vudu, and other 4K UHD streaming content is expected (and needed) in the near future.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Even more apps \xe2\x80\x93 The Bolt also supports Plex, Pandora, Spotify, and Rdio, connecting you with content you have on your home network, as well as tunes from popular streaming music services.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Support for Apple TV and Fire TV \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo would probably prefer that you invest in one of its TiVo Mini boxes to share stored content with other televisions in the house, but with support for Apple Airplay and a new TiVo Android app available for Fire TV, you can use the streamers you might already have to access all of your recordings. The TiVo Mini is still the best tool for getting the most out of the Bolt, however, with support for SkipMode, QuickMode, and access to streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Remote finder \xe2\x80\x93 Press a button on the back of the Bolt and a little song will play from your remote, enabling you to find it among the couch cushions, in the fridge, or wherever else you are prone to misplacing it.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Not new but still awesome'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'TiVo offers the best search feature available on the market. Simply plug the title of what you want to watch into the OneSearch box, and TiVo will show you where you can watch it and how much, if anything, it will cost you. When you search for a movie or TV show, TiVo polls your DVR recordings, live TV, VOD (in select markets), and apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant, and Vudu (depending on whether you have a subscription) to show you where you can watch and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fee involved. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to avoid paying twice for a flick you already paid to have access to.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app for '
b'\xc2\xa0and '
b'Android'
b'\xc2\xa0lets you watch live and stored content anywhere you have an Internet connection. And if you know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be away from the Internet for a long period of time, you can download your stored recordings for offline viewing any time you want. The app also works as a remote control and allows users to manage recordings.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Performance'
b'\n'
b'Current TiVo owners will be happy to know the Bolt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t present any unpleasant surprises. The interface looks and feels exactly as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no learning curve. Aside from having to manage some settings in order to get your OnePass recordings going and secure access to your streaming service accounts (entering usernames and passwords), getting the Bolt up and running is a piece of cake.'

b'TiVo Mobile App'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Those new to TiVo will wonder how they ever put up with their cable company\xe2\x80\x99s terrible interface for so long. Unnecessarily long strings of menu options are a thing of the past with most common commands just a few clicks away. And for a really easy search experience, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app cuts a lot of time out of data entry.'
b'\n'
b'For this review, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on evaluating the new features the Bolt brings to the table. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with QuickSkip which was everything we had hoped it would be. Remarkably, we were able to skip entire segments of The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon so that we could get to the parts we really wanted to see. The skip is nearly instantaneous, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not certain whether you\xe2\x80\x99re watching a show that is QuickSkip enabled, the Bolt will remind you. Our only complaint (and likely an unreasonable one) is that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use the feature on every show, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just us being greedy. The feature covers most of the primetime favorites, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be plenty for most.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'QuickMode is a great idea, but we think it will take some getting used to for most folks. Returning to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, the comedian and host often speaks quickly enough that speeding him up makes some of what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying unintelligible. On top of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain comedy to the sped-up, quick-clipped movement you see when watching standard TV programming. However, we imagine this feature will be great for golf and other slow-paced sports, and an absolute God-send for any long lectures one might have to sit through. Now if only we could QuickMode life when we wanted to!'
b'\n'
b'Streaming 4K UHD media went exactly as expected. We think TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s superior services and search abilities make using the Bolt appealing as an alternative to using the 4K UHD apps embedded in Smart TVs. The Bolt also packs plenty of horsepower, quickly loading apps and keeping buffering to a minimum when Internet speeds were sufficient.'
b'\n'
b'Gripes'
b'\n'
b'Our complaints are few. Chief among them, however, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no Amazon Prime Instant 4K UHD support right out of the box. You get Amazon Prime, sure, just no 4K UHD video, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a disappointment.'
b'\n'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99re also sad that out-of-home streaming isn\xe2\x80\x99t available at launch, though TiVO promises it will be offered in a future firmware update.'
b'\n'
b'The Bolt isn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to handle streaming High Dynamic Range (HDR) content yet, either. The company told Digital Trends that HDR is too much a moving target, with three different formats competing. That may be true, but Amazon has picked its pony, so we can only hope TiVo is prepared to react when Amazon brings this new element of 4K UHD video to consumers.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Bill Roberson/Digital Trends'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'We should note that the Bolt runs a little warm. Conveniently, however, the box\xe2\x80\x99s exhaust fan is located underneath the chassis at the apex of the angle, maximizing exhaust and cooling potential. The only potential issue we see with the shape, however, is that it is destined to the top component on any stack, as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be placing anything on top of it.'
b'\n'
b'Other issues are just nitpicks. For instance: The included Plex is quartered in the Music and Photos menu, even though it very much plays video.'

b'While Amazon, Apple, Roku, and Google primarily have the attention of so-called cord-cutters and cord-nevers (those who have given up cable or never had it) the TiVo Bolt appeals to everyone \xe2\x80\x93 and especially cable subscribers \xe2\x80\x93 with a long list of useful features you simply won\xe2\x80\x99t find anywhere else. In a world where the digital content we want to watch is smeared across a jagged landscape, the TiVo Bolt does an outstanding job of putting everything you want to watch, and listen to, in one place. Without a doubt, the Bolt is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s most outstanding product to date.'

b'If you want to ditch cable without losing the cable DVR experience\xe2\x80\x94warts and all\xe2\x80\x94the TiVo Roamio OTA is your answer.'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s $400 DVR for over-the-air channels has all the creature comforts of a cable box, from the traditional channel grid and button-packed remote control to the seemingly limitless recording options for TV shows and movies. And like TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s own cable boxes, it comes with some powerful ad-skipping features.'
b'But TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old-school approach to recording broadcasts from an antenna also brings some baggage. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get lost in the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s labyrinthine menus, or forget what button you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to press. And while TiVo tries to be a complete cord-cutting solution with both over-the-air and streaming video, its options for the latter can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with dedicated streaming boxes like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Nvidia Shield TV.'
b'Hefty hardware'
b'The TiVo Roamio OTA is a hulking piece of creaky plastic, more like a cable box than a modern streaming device. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s an HDMI output, an optical audio jack for connecting to older sound systems, and, quizzically, a couple USB ports whose only purpose is to charge other devices (external USB storage is not supported). You supply your own antenna, which plugs into the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial input.'
b'Michael Brown'
b'\n'
b"If you want to expand the Roamio OTA's storage, you'll need to replace its existing internal drive. The USB ports are only good for charging devices and the only compatible e-SATA drive was discontinued."
b'\n'
b'Inside, the box has 1TB of storage\xe2\x80\x94good for about 150 hours of HD programming\xe2\x80\x94and four tuners, so you can watch or record four programs at once. The internal drive is replaceable, but while the Roamio OTA technically allows external storage via a rear e-SATA port, the only supported drive is WD\xe2\x80\x99s DVR Extender, which is no longer manufactured or sold.'
b'Equally cable-like is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s remote control, a hefty implement with more than 40 buttons for changing channels, controlling the TV, controlling playback, and navigating through the TiVo Guide. Having almost every conceivable function just a button press away makes some sense, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to create whiplash for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s used to streaming remotes, with their minimalist designs, contextual on-screen menus, and voice search.'
b'The remote does, however, have some welcome departures from cable boxes: It uses an RF signal to control the TiVo\xe2\x80\x94no line-of-sight required\xe2\x80\x94but still includes an IR blaster for your television\xe2\x80\x99s volume, power, and input. Best of all, it lets you easily skip advertisements. Pressing up or the green \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button during commercials automatically takes you to the end of the break on certain programs, and there\xe2\x80\x99s also a dedicated button for jumping ahead by 30 seconds.'
b'Jared Newman/TechHive'
b'\n'
b"TiVo's remote is loaded with buttons. On the bright side, it has both RF and infrared transmitters."
b'\n'
b'TiVo used to charge for DVR service, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the $400 price. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to pay up front, but in the long run it beats paying TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old $15-per-month service charge.'
b'Neverending options'
b'In terms of raw capabilities, the TiVo Roamio OTA offers an impressive amount of granular controls. When setting up a series recording\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cOnePass\xe2\x80\x9d in TiVo lingo\xe2\x80\x94you can record just new airings, limit recordings to a specific channel, record in HD only, record in SD only, keep only recent recordings, keep recordings only until you run out space, and add buffer time on either end of the recording. Through TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWishList\xe2\x80\x9d section, you can even program recordings for a specific actor, director, category, or keyword.'
b'TiVo also pulls TV episodes from various streaming services into OnePass, so if a show is on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu, it\xe2\x80\x99ll show up in the same list as your over-the-air recordings. The feature will likely be most beneficial to Hulu subscribers, given that service\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on network television. With Netflix and Amazon, you may find that there\xe2\x80\x99s not much overlap between recorded and streaming series.'
b'Jared Newman/TechHive'
b'\n'
b"TiVo's channel guide offers impressively granular control over what you want to watch now and record for later."
b'\n'
b'Use TiVo enough, and the system will even start automatically recording programs that it thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ll like. You\xe2\x80\x99re still in charge of fine-tuning the suggestion algorithms by giving thumbs up or down to whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re watching, but being able to populate the DVR without programming everything manually is a nice way to feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth.'
b'Where TiVo falters is in helping users make sense of its many features. The TiVo Roamio OTA is overwrought with menus that are redundant or of dubious utility, including two separate menus for launching apps, two areas for browsing live TV, and a recommendations row on the main menu that rarely seems relevant. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a menu full of curated movie and TV show \xe2\x80\x9ccollections,\xe2\x80\x9d but TiVo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t label the sources for this content up front, and in many cases the selections are only for rental or purchase.'
b'The whole interface could use a complete overhaul. One is supposedly '
b'coming this year'
b', but we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see how that redesign works on a day-to-day basis.'
b'Jared Newman/TechHive'
b'\n'
b'TiVo\'s curated "collections" don\'t indicate where the content is coming from, so you won\'t know if it\'s included in a service you already have or if you\'ll need to pay more to access it.'
b'\n'
b'Not the one true box'
b'Those issues aside, the TiVo Roamio OTA is also missing some benefits you\xe2\x80\x99d get with other over-the-air DVR solutions.'
b'Its app selection, for instance, is dismal compared to dedicated streaming boxes. New streaming bundles such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now are absent, and the only TV Everywhere apps are HBO Go and Epix. New streaming services like SeeSo, Pluto.TV, and Filmstruck aren\xe2\x80\x99t available either. The apps that do exist also seem slower than their streaming box counterparts, especially those that come from the Opera TV app store. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect TiVo to serve all your streaming needs unless they\xe2\x80\x99re fairly basic.'

b'And unlike OTA DVR products from Tablo, HDHomeRun, and Plex, TiVo can\xe2\x80\x99t stream your recordings onto other connected devices, at least not without additional hardware. Watching TV on your phone or tablet requires a $130 TiVo Stream box, and watching on other televisions requires a '
b'$150 TiVo Mini'
b', raising the cost considerably if you want a whole-home or out-of-home solution.'
b'The TiVo Roamio OTA is still worthwhile for folks who want a powerful DVR solution, but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the vagaries of streaming. With four tuners, ample recording options, and helpful ad-skipping features, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s over-the-air DVR excels at squeezing every bit of value out of your antenna signal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to shake the feeling that its best days are behind it.'

b'MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0TiVo Bolt is\xc2\xa0a DVR. It\xe2\x80\x99s a media-streaming device. It\xe2\x80\x99s a replacement for your cable box.'
b"It's actually all of those, as well as a pricey all-in-one unit geared toward\xc2\xa0the TV lover in a big way."
b"After spending several weeks watching, recording and finding programming via Bolt, I never want to go back to renting my\xc2\xa0Verizon FIOS set-top box again. And unlike the new (and less expensive) Apple TV, or other streaming boxes from Roku and Amazon, the Bolt offers a major consumer plus. You don't have to change the TV input settings to bring on the streaming. Everything is tied together."
b'TiVo imagines a world in which broadcast, cable TV and streaming media apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime all live in one universe, and if you were to search for a TV series like '
b'Big Bang Theory'
b'\xc2\xa0on the Bolt, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find entries for CBS, local syndication or streaming on Amazon Prime.'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s program guide is more viewer-friendly than what I get on my cable box, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to read and more colorful, and finding my taped shows takes fewer clicks than with cable.'
b'TiVo threw in a bunch of fun features to sweeten the deal. A \xe2\x80\x9cskip\xe2\x80\x9d button automatically jumps over commercials, taking you from the first segment of the show to the second. It\'s\xc2\xa0a total blast. Fine print alert, though: "skip"\xc2\xa0only works on 20 channels, the broadcast networks and selected cable channels such as AMC, Food Network and Comedy Central, and with shows that have aired from 4 p.m. to midnight.'
b'It wasn\'t that long ago that the broadcast networks were up in arms about technology like this, when the Dish Network introduced the "Hopper" to skip ads. But with TiVo\'s "skip," there has been barely a peep.\xc2\xa0To access the feature with\xc2\xa0TiVo, you need to look for the "SKIP" tag on your recorded show, and then once it starts, hit the D button on the remote.'
b"TiVo's remote"
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'(Photo: TiVo)'
b'Via TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s terrific smartphone app for Apple and Android devices, you can watch recorded shows on your device\xc2\xa0within your home network, or just use it as a remote to change channels and adjust volume.'
b'Like streaming boxes from Apple, Roku and others, the Bolt has a collection of entertainment apps \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Vudu and others, but the offerings are skimpy compared to others. TiVo says other apps will be joining the lineup, including HuluPlus and potentially HBO Now.'
b"Unlike the new Apple TV, the Bolt can show programming that's been presented in ultra-high definition 4K\xc2\xa0via the Netflix and Amazon Prime apps."
b"One feature TV lovers should get a kick out of is\xc2\xa0TiVo's suggestions. Once you start recording shows, TiVo begins to figure out your tastes\xc2\xa0and records other shows. For instance, once I asked TiVo to record every episode of "
b'Late Night with Stephen Colbert'
b', it also added'
b'The Daily Show'
b". (Not that I specifically wanted them, but what the heck. They're nice to have.) But what if you buy the entry-level $300 unit with 500 GB storage\xc2\xa0and don't want these shows clogging up your hard drive? TiVo says not to worry \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0your suggested shows will be deleted first when TiVo looks to make room for the shows you go out to record."
b'STITCHER'
b'TiVo Bolt review from USA TODAY TalkingTech'
b'Finally, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at price. The Bolt starts at $300, but includes one free year of Tivo service, which is $15 per month.'
b"Still, that's twice as much as an Apple TV or about three times the cost of a Roku."
b"Those boxes, of course, can't record shows\xc2\xa0or give you a guide to what's playing on TV."
b'In this day and age of on-demand streaming, do we still need program guides and DVRs?'
b"There's a lot that can be watched at one click. But there's still plenty that can't always be seen this way, such as\xc2\xa0complete newscasts, sporting events\xc2\xa0and shows like the aforementioned "
b'Daily Show\xc2\xa0'
b'or '
b'Late Show'
b'.'
b"I like having a DVR and really like the commercial skipper. Plus I love the idea of replacing a cable box with a unit that isn't owned by Verizon."
b"It's not cutting the cord, but shaving it a bit."
b'I give Verizon $420 yearly to rent two set-top DVR boxes. But with the Bolt, I was able to request a \xe2\x80\x9cCableCard,\xe2\x80\x9d which continued to give me service without having to rent Verizon\xe2\x80\x99s equipment.'
b'My $420 got whacked down to $120 a year \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0$5 a month for each card and now the bottom line is a yearly savings of $150.'
b'Spoiler alert: Cable companies are notorious for being tough to deal with when the "CableCard" is requested, and my experience was no different. It took many calls, tweets and eventually two visits\xc2\xa0to make it work\xc2\xa0for simply inserting a card in\xc2\xa0a TiVo box. But Verizon had to activate it.'
b'USA TODAY'
b'Cutting the cord with a CableCARD'
b'With the CableCard\xc2\xa0finally installed and TiVo Bolt running the show, TV is more enjoyable, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to change the TV input to go back and forth between cable and the streaming box. And\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sending Verizon less money.'

b'Love watching TV shows without commercials? Then you might be interested in the new TiVo Bolt, an all-in-one DVR with a mode that lets you '
b'zip through advertisements'
b'\n'
b'In fact, the new player seems to be all about speed. Not only does it rocket you through commercials\xe2\x80\x94one at a time or an entire block\xe2\x80\x94using SkipMode, it also has an innovative QuickMode, which the company claims wisks you through recorded shows up to 30 percent faster without causing any audio sync issues. Imagine watching a replay of the Academy Awards, for example, in less than three hours\xe2\x80\x94all without missing a word.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"SkipMode doesn't work with sports\xe2\x80\x94so you'll have to live with beer ads\xe2\x80\x94but QuickMode can speed up the action during play lags."
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Like other TiVo models, the distinctively angled Bolt box offers multiple sources of content\xe2\x80\x94cable, video on demand, over-the air (via an antenna) broadcasts, and streaming\xe2\x80\x94with universal search capability. It can also record up to four shows at once. And its HDMI 2.0 output makes this the first TiVo to support 4K video content.'
b'\n'
b"The SkipMode ad feature frees you from repeatedly hitting a 30-second skip button or futilely trying to pull your finger off the fast-forward button precisely at commercial's end. For now, though, it's somewhat limited. It only works with recorded programs from specific providers\xe2\x80\x94TiVo says that includes the top 20 most-watched networks\xe2\x80\x94and (unlike QuickMode) it's not offered at all on sports programs. To see if a show is skip-enabled, look in your My Shows folder, where titles will be listed with skip icons beside them."
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Do you hate commercials?'
b'\n'
b'Let us know what you think of the new TiVo Bolt in the comments section below'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"The TiVo Bolt will start appearing in stores October 4th. It's already available online at TiVo, Amazon, and Best Buy. It comes in two flavors: The 500GB hard drive model costs $300 and the 1TB version is priced at $400. Both include one year of TiVo service, which currently costs $150."
b'\n'
b'TiVo says it will offer a few updates this fall, including the ability to create a personalized "what to watch" screen based on your hobbies and interests, and a social sharing feature that provides links so your friends can watch the same show as you.'
b'\n'
b"The TiVo Bolt replaces the basic TiVo Roamio model in the company's lineup, but the other "
b'Roamio models'
b'\n'
b'The pursuit of commercial-free TV is nothing new, of course. More than two decades ago a company called Arista introduced a product called Commercial Brake that let you skip past ads on your VCR, and more recently the '
b'AutoHop feature'
b'\n'
b'In comparison to the Roamio DVRs, however, the Bolt has a faster processor, improved Wi-Fi (it supports 802.11AC), and more memory, so we imagine it will operate more quickly. If you decide to get a TiVo Bolt, let us know what you think of it, and how well the commercial skip feature works.'

b'Back in September, TiVo '
b'Bolt+ DVR'
b', perhaps the most luxurious set-top box ever created. With a monstrous 3TB hard drive, 4K and six tuners, it staked its claim as the king of the hill. TiVo maintained the sleek design of the previous generation despite upping '
b'the price tag to $499'
b'. Over the last month, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with the Bolt+ as my everyday DVR and now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to share some thoughts. Does TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s high-end feature list\xc2\xa0justify the price tag? Head below to find out\xe2\x80\xa6'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been two full generations of products since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the TiVo ecosystem.\xc2\xa0In that time, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wandered through the likes of the '
b'Hopper'
b', '
b'Genie'
b', '
b'Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s X1'
b'\n'
b'TiVo has always stood tall with its impressive software and search functionality. While other providers have spent significant resources focusing on smartphone features and multi-room capabilities, TiVo continually invested deeper into its season pass features. I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump into the software aspect in a moment, but first lets look at the arduous process of adding this DVR to my setup.'
b'\n'
b'One area that has plagued '
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0lineup'
b'\n'
b'The Bolt+ continues the trend of requiring a '
b'subscription to TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service plan'
b'. This cost is in addition to any fees your provider may (likely) impose with this DVR. You can opt for a month-to-month plan at $15, full year at $150 or TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s all-in service plan for $550. That means the Bolt+ could cost upwards of $1,050 before you even factor in your cable subscription. While that is likely to be a deterrent for some, let\xe2\x80\x99s dive into the features before making a final conclusion.'
b'\n'
b'Design'
b'\n'
b'TiVo recycled the original Bolt design on its newest DVR, with the only change being its black casing. Most of the real evolution occurred on the inside. TiVo claims that Bolt+ is \xe2\x80\x9c33% smaller\xe2\x80\x9d than competitors in this category. While I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to that specifically, it certainly takes up less room than my Time Warner set-top box.'
b'\n'
b'On the back is a coax connector, optical audio out, 3.5mm jack, HDMI 2.0 port, gigabit ethernet, dual USB 2.0 ports, an eSATA connector and a spot for the 12V power supply. A tiny button resides off the left that triggers the remote finder feature. Flipping the Bolt + over reveals a hidden door that covers the CableCARD slot. You\xe2\x80\x99ll note that this model does not support OTA signals (but the original Bolt does). The built-in tuner can handle up to six shows at once, up from four on the previous generation.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'It\xc2\xa0is anchored by a 3TB hard drive inside that can store up to 450 hours of HD footage. For comparison, DirecTV\xe2\x80\x99s Genie can only hold 200 hours. TiVo has upped the internal processing power significantly over the previous generation with three times the processing power and DDR memory.'
b'\n'
b'Of course, your DVR experience isn\xe2\x80\x99t complete without a solid remote. TiVo includes a color-coded ergonomic remote that is full-featured but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t overwhelm. Given the price tag here, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve expected something with a bit more flash but it gets the job done. Menu and TV controls are at the top while playback and channel selection reside in the lower-third. The remote has an excellent tactile feel to it, which is a welcome feature. TiVo does an excellent job of matching features shown on-screen with corresponding colors on the remote.'
b'\n'
b'Software'
b'\n'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s robust software has always been the cornerstone of its product line. While hardware\xc2\xa0comes and goes, it\xe2\x80\x99s the top-grade search functionality and features that have sustained this brand for many years. Thankfully, we can say that this trend continues on the Bolt+.'
b'\n'
b'One of the calling-card features from TiVo in 2016 is its \xe2\x80\x98Unified Entertainment System\xe2\x80\x99. Like most consumers, I\xe2\x80\x99m a subscriber to other streaming services in addition to cable. Before the Bolt+, I had to switch between my Apple TV or Xbox One to enjoy content from Netflix and the like. TiVo brings that all together into one streamlined experience.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'OneSearch presents your subscription services content in-line with shows and movies on cable (kind of like Apple\xe2\x80\x99s '
b'). For example, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to watch an episode of The Office, a simple search reveals all of the upcoming options on cable alongside the full catalog of content on Netflix. There\xe2\x80\x99s no switching back and forth between two apps, with TiVo it\xe2\x80\x99s all there together. I find this feature to be particularly valuable as the third-party app experience on other streaming media players can be very hit-or-miss.'
b'\n'
b'Another new feature on the Bolt line is SkipMode. TiVo actually has real humans marking when commercial breaks begin and end on popular shows during primetime. When you go to watch recorded content, you simply press a button on the remote to skip through the entire commercial break. I\xe2\x80\x99m someone that hates trying to hit the play button at just the right time when fast forwarding, so this feature really stands out for me. I love that TiVo has people on the backend nailing the start and stop times at just the right moment. Another feature, although not as notable, is QuickMode that takes your recorded content and plays it 30% faster with pitch-correct audio. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find this to be as useful, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting feature for sports, particularly baseball.'
b'\n'
b'Other Features'
b'\n'
b'TiVo is also pushing smartphone connectivity as a main feature on Bolt+. Overall, the iOS experience is ok but not the best that I\xe2\x80\x99ve used. DirecTV\xe2\x80\x99s Genie app really is second-to-none in this area. Right off the bat, it was disappointing that TiVo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer native support for iPhone Plus models. Video playback works fine but otherwise everything is just a little off.'
b'\n'
b'That said, you can access your recorded content or live TV on up to four devices at a time plus manage all of your OnePass subscriptions. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a mind blowing feature but its one that TiVo executes fairly well. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any issues with streaming content during my review and was overall pleased with the experience. The smartphone app is available '
b'on iOS and Android'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Although a footnote in the laundry list of specs, Bolt+ has a handy find your remote feature. All you have to do is press a small button on the back of the set-top box and your remote will play a tune. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice fall-back if you\xe2\x80\x99re someone that regularly looses the remote.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo Bolt+ does support 4K video, although I was not able to test that functionality as my provider does not yet offer high resolution content. Overall, I could see an improvement in image quality versus my existing set-top box. As 4K continue to grow, Bolt+ is prepared for the next generation of shows and movies.'
b'\n'
b'Conclusion'
b'\n'
b'TiVo continues\xc2\xa0the trend of being one of the absolute best ways to enjoy television. Its extensive search and backend software make it a dream for someone that records a lot of content through the week. The massive 3TB hard drive and six tuners sit head and shoulders above the competition. It\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the most attractive DVRs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever laid eyes on.'
b'\n'
b'Those compliments aside, TiVo faces an ever-increasing uphill battle against the competition. I referenced my frustration that was caused during the initial setup period with my provider. The bottom line is, all of the big-names in this industry would prefer that you use their own set-top boxes. It allows them to push more content and offer greater control over their customer\xe2\x80\x99s experience. Even worse, DirecTV, Dish Network and Comcast are making huge strides in the areas that TiVo has long dominated. Add in the extra steps required to get the Bolt+ up and running?\xc2\xa0'

b'TiVo Bolt Review'
b'05/03/2016'
b'Helen Back'
b'Falling in Love with TiVo Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Slick\xc2\xa0Features and Elegant Design'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s top tier iteration to the OTA DVR Streaming Box brings together\xc2\xa0your OTA signal, DVR and all your streaming options via a single smooth interface. No need to switch from device to device in order to find the show you want to watch.'
b'One of the most valuable assets in a cord cutters toolbox is the OTA\xc2\xa0DVR. A drawback to over-the-air (OTA) television is that if you miss a show, you miss the show; but DVR\xe2\x80\x99s help restore that balance by helping you record everything. For many cord cutters, the DVR is the bow they use to tie off their cord cutting experience; so making the right choice is always critical. '
b'Most recently, DVR giant TiVo unveiled their next generation of home DVRs, dubbed the Bolt. The Bolt is a product\xc2\xa0upgrade on their existing, yet similar product, the '
b'TiVo Roamio'
b'. This latest iteration of the companies home DVR is meant to provide an\xc2\xa0all in one entertainment experience, replacing all other '
b'streaming devices'
b'TiVo Bolt Features'
b'Featuring four tuners, the Bolt allows you to record up to four shows at once. To record the content, you will of course\xc2\xa0still need to connect to\xc2\xa0an '
b'OTA antenna'
b', but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new. The Bolt also works with cable television, but who cares? We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to\xc2\xa0cut costs, not inflate them.'
b'From a hardware perspective, everything has been upgraded and condensed.\xc2\xa0So the Bolt is not only smaller than other DVRs, it\xe2\x80\x99s also faster and more powerful.'
b'As far as price is concerned, the 500GB Bolt is going to cost you '
b'$230 (Amazon'
b')\xc2\xa0will provide approximately 75 hours of HD video recording. Or you can go with the 1TB version, costing around\xc2\xa0'
b'$330 (Amazon'
b'), and you will get\xc2\xa0approximately 150 hours of HD video recording. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also have to pay service fee; which will either run you $15 a month, $150 a year or $600 for a lifetime.'
b'TiVo Bolt Streaming'
b'With online streaming capabilities, you can download streaming apps like Netflix, '
b'Amazon Prime'
b', Hulu, and YouTube. No word on whether or not it will support '
b'Sling TV'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan of super high resolution, then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got good news: the Bolt supports 4k. Currently, you can only get 4k from YouTube and Netflix, but 4k for Amazon Prime is on the way. Sadly, the 4k support doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much for you in the way of OTA television; we\xe2\x80\x99re years away from that (at least for the average consumer).'
b'TiVo Bolt Interface'
b'Where the Bolt shines brightest is in its interface. The TiVo Bolts makes it incredibly easy to search for new content across streaming services and OTA television. You can search for shows by genre, actor, director, etc\xe2\x80\xa6 And all of your content is sorted by title, not by source.'
b'What that means is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to watch '
b'The Flash'
b', you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to jump between Netflix, Hulu, and your DVR. Instead, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just pull up the show and all of the available content will be there. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also be able to see content available for purchase and be able to compare it across different services.'
b'To learn more about what the TiVo Remot has to offer, here is a '
b'link '
b'to a nice informational graphic.'
b'DVR Features'
b'The Bolt also features some pretty smart recording features that can automatically record content that it thinks you might like or can record content based off a specific actor or director. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not a fan of automatic recording, no worries; you can easily turn it off.'
b'Perhaps my favorite feature is QuickMode, which allows you to speed up a program by 30 percent\xe2\x80\xa6 with pitch-correct audio. That means if you\xe2\x80\x99re a glutton for punishment and decided to watch a Presidential Debate, you can speed things up without having to listen to the chipmunk voice.'
b'This also has a huge appeal for '
b'sports fans'
b'\xc2\xa0with not a lot of time. Ever want to record your favorite '
b'The Adobe Flash Player is required for video playback.'

b'TiVo Bolt'
b'All in all the Bolt is a fantastic DVR with a wonderful interface, features, and design. That being said, the worst part about it is the price; especially the monthly service fee. If you\xe2\x80\x99re the kind of person that loves to tinker with things, you may be better off '
b'building your own DVR'
b'media center'
b'. '
b'However, if you\xe2\x80\x99re the kind of person that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind paying a little more for an intuitive and enjoyable experience; you should definitely give the Bolt a look. '
b'What do you think about the Bolt? Is it a must-have for cord cutters or just another thing you don\xe2\x80\x99t need? Sound off in the comments below!'

b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a general sentiment in the TV industry that cord cutting (the art of ending your traditional cable subscription) will very soon be the norm. With the latest F.C.C. '
b'announcement'
b'TiVo, the television device manufacturer and technology company is disproving that by innovating around your cable subscription, even your cable company isn\xe2\x80\x99t. The new '
b'TiVo BOLT'
b', released in 2015, not only allows you to completely skip commercial breaks, but the connected device includes apps for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and most recently, Hulu.'
b'Found Remote is giving the TiVo BOLT 4.8/5 Remotes.'
b'The TiVo Bolt costs $299.99 and includes a free year of the TiVo service. After the first year, the service costs $149.99 per year (roughly $12.50/month). Here are the details of my experience test driving the TiVo BOLT at home over the past few months.'

b'Transitioning from my DVR to a TiVo:'
b'Like many I was skeptical about moving away from my Verizon FiOS DVR because I had been using it for so long and generally didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to complain about. I also had recorded programs saved on my DVR from years ago that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose in the transition.'
b'Additionally, the general sentiment around TiVo among the ignorant (which I was once myself) was that TiVo was some company from the late 1990s early 2000s that had been made irrelevant once the cable companies white-labeled their own digital video recorders.'
b'Then I slowly began to learn that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case. Not only was TiVo still around but also they had been innovating around the television experience for the last decade;I, on the other hand, had been stuck in the past with a DVR that had looked and operated the same way for the last decade. After a friend in the industry recommended that I switch and after another '
b'Setting up the device:'
b'When the TiVo arrived it came in a beautiful box, with fun messaging all over it about how they\xe2\x80\x99ve been innovating the TV experience. Setting it up was easy for the most part. I had avoided renting a CableCARD from Verizon because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% clear to me if I needed one or if I could instead use my Verizon box as a proxy until I was sure I wanted to stick with the TiVo.'
b'After I learned that I definitely needed a CableCARD, I needed to figure out what a cablecard actually was. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s website said I would '
b'talks'
b'When the CableCARD arrived it was very easy to setup and the only issue I had was that for many channels, the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data wasn\xe2\x80\x99t showing up - meaning that for many channels it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t showing me the names of the programs that were on. After some troubleshooting with TiVo support, I ran the setup again and it worked fine.'
b'Setting up my preferences, recorded shows and apps:'
b'After the small hiccups in setting up the device I was a bit worried about other hurdles that I might face. Then I realized that the two small issues I had dealt with, confusion around a CableCARD and issues with the EPG data were simply cases of TiVo having to mold around old-school ways that the providers distribute TV.'
b'From the moment I finished setting up the device, I felt as though I travelled into the future to a world where traditional TV had actually been innovated.'
b'I was able to customize the guide so that only the channels I actually watched showed up - this took me two minutes at most.'
b'There was no way to automatically have my Verizon DVRed shows show up on TiVo, but after making a list of all my DVRed shows it took me just an hour to set them all up under TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s '
b'OnePass'
b'If I happened to be watching a standard definition channel by accident, TiVo would ask me if I\xe2\x80\x99d rather watch it in HD instead. The entire user experience and design was amazing. Navigating through their software from apps, to TV, to my recorded shows felt like I was on a computer more than a TV. What would take me five minutes of frustratingly slow selecting on my DVR took a mere few seconds on the TiVo. After a day I was shocked anyone was still using the DVR their cable companies provided.'
b'They also had a trending section to show what most people were watching on TV right now. This is made possible based on the fact that you are watching traditional TV on a device that\xe2\x80\x99s actually connected to the internet. I was amazed.'
b'The only thing that tripped me up was that I had the \xe2\x80\x9cSuggestions\xe2\x80\x9d setting turned on, which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I\xe2\x80\x99m a recorder who only wants new episodes recorded and even though I selected that option when I set up each of my OnePass shows there were still older episodes recording. This was because of the \xe2\x80\x9cSuggestions\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'setting'
b', which seems well intentioned but ended up confusing me a lot. When I turned it off everything was back to normal.'
b'The TiVo app:'
b'My Verizon FiOS app had been okay. When it worked I was able to record shows remotely and check what was in my queue. Besides that I used it to pay my bill. The TiVo '
b'app'
b'It can easily be used as a remote for your TiVo and you can access and watch anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve recorded from your iPhone as long as you are connected to the same wifi that your TiVo is connected to. Once watching on your iPhone you can then use Apple\xe2\x80\x99s AirPlay to stream what you\xe2\x80\x99re watching to another TV in your house that has an AppleTV. Further, if you want to watch something that\xe2\x80\x99s currently on the air, with one tap you can do that and TiVo will start recording it so you can access it from your device.'
b'The best part is that accessing the content works seamlessly via their player. There\xe2\x80\x99s no delay, rewinding and skipping ahead is easy and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent someone from using the the TiVo with the main TV it\xe2\x80\x99s connected to.'
b'TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s VP of Product Management and Strategy '
b'Jim Denney'
b'Experiencing TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ads:'
b'After a couple of weeks of experiencing TV through TiVo I started to realize how much amazing data they were sitting on top of. Over Thanksgiving I was catching up on Showtime\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland which I had recorded. Whenever I paused it an ad from HBO would show up at the bottom encouraging me to watch The Leftovers, making corny, but catchy references to Thanksgiving leftovers.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how Showtime would feel about that but it was extremely clever and targeted advertising and did cause me to catch up on The Leftovers right after I finished Homeland. The potential for non-intrusive and addressable advertising is huge with TiVo.'
b'Traditional On-Demand via TiVo:'
b'The biggest disappointment was the fact that I could no longer access Verizon FiOS On-Demand using the CableCARD with my TiVo. Denney explained why Verizon and Time Warner aren\xe2\x80\x99t offering On-Demand to TiVo. \xe2\x80\x9cVoD in our retail offering is integrated on a case by case basis in cooperation with the operator,\xe2\x80\x9d Denney explained to Found Remote. \xe2\x80\x9cComcast and Cox are the two operators that have cooperated in this effort so far,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'
b'For a minute I thought this might be a deal breaker for me as I used On-Demand often to binge watch and access shows I had forgotten to record or was unable to because I was recording too many other shows.'
b'It quickly became a non-issue for two reasons. With the TiVo I was able to record up to four shows at the same time, with my DVR only two. Also, every major network now has their own apps where you can watch their contact so On-Demand is quickly becoming a senior citizen along with DVDs and non-smartphones.'
b'Using Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu:'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m an Apple TV loyalist (the older one, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t purchased the newer more expensive one yet), using Roku mostly to access Amazon Prime Video which isn\xe2\x80\x99t available on the Apple TV. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan on using the streaming apps that TiVo made available, especially since they didn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu (only Netflix and Amazon when it came to the apps I cared about). In December, TiVo '
b'added'
b'I decided to login to my Netflix, Hulu and Amazon accounts on TiVo and since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been using them via TiVo. The reason why is simple - there\xe2\x80\x99s now less of a need to switch inputs on my TV, those few seconds saved means more TV and less jumping around.'
b'Taking back control of my bill:'
b'The ultimate question ends up being - do you actually save money using a TiVo over your provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR. For myself the experience of using a TiVo was so exponentially better that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I had to pay a bit more. In reality, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work when bills are piling up.'
b'Denney explained to Found Remote that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo BOLT also saves you money compared to a cable DVR. Where cable providers charge you not only for channels, but also bill you rental fees, DVR fees, etc., TiVo allows you to pay a one-time price for the box and only one monthly service fee no matter how many TVs you\xe2\x80\x99ve connected to your BOLT.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s my reality: After the one time fee for the device and a free year of their service, the cost per month is only $12.50 compared to the nearly $16.99/month Verizon had been charging me to rent my DVR. The cable card only costs $4.99/month - so after a year I will end up paying about $.50 more for an extremely better experience. I never had a second box in my apartment but the fact that I can now access my shows on my iPhone is giving me an added value that\xe2\x80\x99s way worth the $.50. Also, my Verizon bill is often confusing with taxes and service charges, so one less item I have to worry about on it, is a savior.'
b'How TiVo the company is doing:'
b'TiVo, the company, which is publicly traded on NASDAQ is going through some '
b'major'
b'While their subscribers have traditionally gone down '
b'year over year'
b', the new F.C.C. regulations could change the game completely for them and the need for a CableCARD at all could be obsolete as software takes over.'
b'In addition to acquiring Aereo\xe2\x80\x99s distribution lists and launching an antenna '
b'product'
b', they recently had a major presence at CES showing off the BOLT.'

b'Why you should be using a TiVo to become a cord supplementer:'
b'Denney told Found Remote that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo BOLT brings all of your content together into one place for you to manage.  Features like OnePass, universal search and OTT application support mean that you get one point of control for all content, whether from a streaming service or cable provider.  The result is a much better viewing experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more. As a passionate TV viewer and fan, immediacy and convenience are of utmost importance. I want to watch my favorite shows the second they air, in one experience with as little tapping, clicking or selecting as possible. For awhile I was planning on cutting the cord and using a friend or family member\xe2\x80\x99s password to authenticate into TV everywhere apps.'
b'Found Remote is giving the Tivo BOLT 4.8/5 Remotes for a near perfect experience. .1 Remotes was deducted for the confusion around setup, .05 for the lack of On-Demand integration, and .05 for the confusing Suggestions feature.'
b'Now that I have a TiVo BOLT I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve reclaimed the traditional TV experience, combined it with my favorite streaming apps and a mobile experience, and created that 2016 TV viewing experience I was hoping for.'

I work for the local cable company And hear the Tivo complaints all the time Your guide has been wrong for almost a year! I believe we are getting the east coast, but are supposed to get the mountain time zone. So please fix this problem as soon as possible.            '

b'\n                                    I cancelled my service last year and told them I had thrown out all my boxes. They kept charging me every month. When I called them today They told me I accepted a two month free service. Why would I do that when I have no boxes. They refused to give me a refund I...                            '

b"\n                                    I've been a loyal TIVO owner since the company's founding. When my #3 DVR broke down I replaced it with a BOLT. I won't detail the problems I had trying to repair the former DVR or ordering the BOLT -- suffice it to say customer service was subpar -- not at all what...                            "

b'\n                                    TiVo was purchased 9 yrs ago and worked well. It finally died a year ago so the monthly service was cancelled. The monthly service has a "continual care coverage" policy that states "if your TiVo BOLT or TiVo Roamio needs repair within the first 90 days from your date...                            '

b'What Is the TiVo?'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo is a third-party DVR system that can be hooked up to nearly any cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s service, offering an alternative to the proprietary\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes clunky\xe2\x80\x94DVR systems that cable companies provide.'
b'\n'
b'The company has been in the business for a long time, with the original TiVo coming to market in 1999, and it still offers one of the best values in the DVR business. In fact, we ranked the TiVo T6 third in our roundup of '
b'the best DVRs of 2017'
b'.'
b'\n'
b'How to Get TiVo'
b'\n'
b'There are two ways to get a TiVo:'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'If you have '
b'RCN as a cable provider'
b', you can get a TiVo T6 as your HD DVR system.'
b'\n'
b'You can also buy your own TiVo, either directly from the company or through a third-party seller like Amazon, and then use it with nearly any cable provider.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'This compatibility with multiple providers is what makes TiVo stand out in a world where every cable company offers its own proprietary DVR system with different features and user interfaces.'

b'Other TiVo Models'
b'\n'

b'. They don\xe2\x80\x99t come bundled with cable subscriptions like the T6. Instead, you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay a subscription fee directly to TiVo that is roughly equivalent to the DVR fees you would pay to a cable provider. In terms of features, the BOLT is a newer version than the T6 used by RCN. The main difference is the size and shape\xe2\x80\x94the BOLT is much smaller and curved and can only record four programs at once. It does offer 4K output, though, '
b'which the T6 does not'
b'. The BOLT+ triples the storage of the standard BOLT, from 1 TB to 3 TB.'

b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Monthly Fees'
b'\n'
b'TiVo T6 from RCN'
b'\n'
b'A TiVo T6 from RCN will cost you $15 per month. Whole-Home Bundles start at $20 per month for two TVs and add an extra $5 for every additional box.'
b'\n'
b'Directly from TiVo'
b'\n'
b'If you buy your own TiVo, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay a $14.99 per month subscription fee to TiVo, like the DVR fee that cable providers charge. You can also opt to pay the fee annually for $149.99, saving $30, or go for the All-In Plan, which is a one-time fee of $549.99 that covers you for life. With the All-In Plan, you\xe2\x80\x99ll break even at about forty-two months (a little over three years), so if you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be using TiVo longer than that, you could potentially save quite a bit of money.'
b'\n'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Provider Compatibility'
b'\n'
b'As mentioned, the TiVo boxes can work with any cable provider. This means that you can buy your own TiVo and take the same DVR experience across multiple providers, which is great if you move. Plus, with more providers moving away from the contract model, you have the freedom to try out several different providers without learning a new DVR interface every time.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo does not currently work with other fiber services like '
b'AT&T U-verse'
b'\xe2\x80\x94if you want fiber, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stick with Fios. As far as satellite goes, you can use a TiVo box with '
b'DIRECTV'
b', but not without some help\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a separate receiver from DIRECTV to use any of the current TiVo models. '

b'\n'
b'The Box'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo T6 is a pretty standard-looking DVR box, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad-looking box by any means. On the left side, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your power button and indicator light. There are no ports on the front\xe2\x80\x94everything is nicely tucked away, giving the T6 a clean, sleek appearance. The TiVo BOLT models add some variety with a white option. The whole BOLT package is much smaller and generally more attractive looking.'
b'\n'
b'The Tech'
b'\n'
b'Inside, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the 1 TB hard drive with plenty of room for your recorded shows. In fact, for its size, the T6 can store more hours of SD programming than any other top DVRs. The HD storage falls a bit short, at only 150 hours, but only hardcore digital pack rats are likely to ever fill that up.'
b'\n'
b'In terms of output, the T6 offers only 1080p HD resolution\xe2\x80\x94no 4K here. While there is still a relative lack of 4K content out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming more common every year, and 4K TVs are seeing big price drops. TiVo does have the newer BOLT series boxes that support 4K, but as of right now, you can only get them directly from TiVo, which can get expensive. Hopefully RCN will upgrade to one of the newer BOLT options soon.'
b'\n'
b'The Remote'
b'\n'
b'The remote is a standard size and shape with a clean look. The number pad sits near the bottom, while the middle is dominated by playback controls and a big on-demand button. At the top, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find buttons for various functions like the TV guide and the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons that TiVo uses to build your recommendation list.'

b'Integrated Search Function'
b'\n'
b'TiVo really excels here. The integration between your streaming services and provider programming is an outstanding idea that works well. You can search for a movie or show and receive results from not only live TV, but also the Netflix and Hulu apps, or any of the other included services you might use. This can save a lot of time since you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to jump in and out of different apps or the TV guide.'
b'\n'
b'Recommendations'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo will also recommend programming to you based on what it thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ll like. It learns your preferences based on your use of the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons on the remote. The suggestions work well, but if you find them lacking, TiVo suggests making more liberal use of the thumbs-up button, giving the same program two or three ratings rather than just one. In any case, it\xe2\x80\x99s a handy feature that can help dig up shows you may not have discovered otherwise.'
b'\n'
b'Streaming Apps'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo boxes have built-in apps for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, which should cover most streaming needs. Add in RCN\xe2\x80\x99s on-demand library and you should never have a problem finding something to watch.'
b'\n'
b'Mobile Apps'
b'\n'
b'TiVo offers mobile apps for '
b'Android'
b'\n'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The Verdict'
b'\n'
b'Whether you choose to get your TiVo through RCN or independently, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to go wrong. All the TiVo boxes offer competitive specs, great user experiences, and convenient integration of streaming and cable TV services. Add in the ability to take it with you to new providers, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder we named it the \xe2\x80\x9cBest Value\xe2\x80\x9d in '

b"The TiVo Bolt integrates traditional cable and 4K streaming into a seamless, single system. It's lacking a bit in app variety, but if you're a serious TV enthusiast clinging on to cable, the Bolt is near unbeatable in what it offers."

b'Update:'
b'Original review below...'
b'\n'
b'In the early aughts, TiVo pioneered a new technology called digital video recording (DVR) that captured the spirit of watching television. It freed entertainment from the shackles of time, and gave viewers the ability to watch content on their own terms.'
b'It would take nearly a decade for traditional cable operators to catch on and employ that technology in their own boxes, passing those development costs onto subscribers along the way. Then, when DVR finally went mainstream, the industry turned away from cable entirely, making all the work that those companies put into the DVR over the last few years moot.'
b'It might not make much sense, then, for a company like TiVo to continue developing DVRs when the term "cord-cutter" has been on everyone\'s mind for the past five years. It might seem even more confusing to see a DVR \xe2\x80\x93 well, it\'s more than a DVR, but I\'ll get to that in a minute \xe2\x80\x93 cost $299 for a 500GB version or $399 for a 1TB system. (This specific system isn\'t available in the UK or Australia, however TiVo\'s technology can be found in set-top boxes made by Virgin.)'
b"But the beauty of TiVo's new Bolt system is that it's more than a DVR or a "
b'4K'
b'Put as succinctly as possible: the TiVo Bolt is your shows and movies, when you want them, where you want them.'
b'Design'
b"Most of us have anywhere between two and four black rectangular boxes sitting in our entertainment cabinet. They're usually perfectly flat, stack nicely and look like they were designed by the exact same engineer."
b'But instead of following in those footsteps, the TiVo Bolt has some pretty surprising design ideas, including a sloped top and an all-white shell that houses some seriously fast hardware.'
b"If you're looking for a size comparison to other DVRs, the TiVo Bolt is 33% smaller than TiVo's own Roamio and 65% smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro. For non-TiVo owners, that translates to 11.4 x 7.3 x 1.8 inches (W x D x H), or roughly the size of a Sony PS4."
b"The front, top and sides of the box are all smooth and, for the most part, completely blank. There's an indicator LED and a small TiVo logo on the front, but otherwise the Bolt is a brazenly blank slate."
b"Spin it around to the back, and you'll find a Remote Finder button, cablecard slot, coax (Digital Cable, ATSC, MoCA) input, optical audio out, L/R audio, an HDMI 2.0a port for 24fps 4K or 60fps 1080p, a 10/100/1000 Mbps ethernet port, two USB 2.0 and an external storage port (eSATA)."
b"(Note: You'll need to reach out to your cable company and obtain a cablecard if you want the TiVo Bolt to integrate with your cable service.)"
b'The big draws of the box itself are the external storage port (in case you decide to go for the smaller internal hard drive), and the equally fun and practical remote finder to help you track down your pad when it goes MIA. There are enough ports here to run an audio signal straight to your TV and soundbar or simply pass the signal through a receiver and let it do all the heavy audio lifting.'
b"Speaking of the remote, though, there's little to complain about regarding TiVo's pack-in controller. Most of the buttons will be familiar \xe2\x80\x93 you've surely seen a few dozen numerical pads in your life \xe2\x80\x93 but I found the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons a smart touch."
b'Features and TiVo service'
b'Features on the TiVo Bolt are premium in both senses of the word. They are both exceptional in their execution in creating one of the best TV-watching experiences on the market, but these features also cost more than you might want to shell out for.'
b"Let's cover the cost first. A brand-new Bolt comes with one year of TIVo's service for free. Considering one year of TiVo service costs $149, that's a pretty solid deal. After the trial runs out, you can either switch to a monthly plan to the tune of $14.99 per month or opt in to the annual plan for $149 plus tax."
b'So what does your investment net you? Access to services like OnePass, which intelligently scans the available channels and records any instance of a TV show or movie the next time it plays \xe2\x80\x93 without ever wasting space on duplicate content and prioritizing HD quality.'
b"If you've ever used universal search on a new "
b'Apple TV'
b', Roku or '
b'Chromecast'
b", TiVo also has a similar function, called Smart Search, that finds every source for the content you're interested in and lists them by price. It currently searches Fox, PBS, AMC, CBS, Showtime, Hulu, Netflix, Vudu, NBC, Bravo, FX, Comedy Central and Amazon \xe2\x80\x93 as well as cable or over-the-air signals \xe2\x80\x93 for the cheapest source of whatever you want to watch."
b"But the creme-de-la-creme of TiVo features are SkipMode, which enables you to completely skip over commercials with the press of a button when watching recorded shows, and QuickMode, which speeds up a recorded show by 30% without raising the pitch of the characters' voices."
b"They're both tremendously helpful to traditional TV watchers that either use cable or an over-the-air antenna, and will radically change the way you view traditional television. Thirty-minute shows will be reduced to roughly 20 minutes and hour-long epics can be compressed into roughly 40-minute blocks. You can watch three episodes of a show in the time it used to take you to watch two. For binge-watchers, like myself, that's well worth the cost of admission."
b"The Bolt is an increasingly competent 4K video player, too. It can currently power its way through Netflix's Ultra-HD library without breaking a sweat, and TiVo says it plans on rolling out Amazon 4K support in the near future. Admittedly, the TiVo Bolt doesn't have the same massive Ultra-HD library as, say, the "
b'Roku 4'
b"The biggest fault of the system is that, when it's compared to the other streaming video systems out there \xe2\x80\x93 game systems like "
b'PS4'
b'Xbox One'
b', '
b'Amazon Fire TV'
b', Apple TV and Roku \xe2\x80\x93 the TiVo comes in a little light on apps.'
b"The argument could be made, of course, that most TiVo owners will opt for traditional cable or an antenna, but being able to use apps like Showtime Anytime or HBO Now would allow for more of a customizable experience suited for today's market. (Do check out "
b'Plex'
b', though, which allows you to stream content you already own from a nearby home theater PC [HTPC] to your TV for free.)'
b'We liked'
b"The TiVo Bolt is an unbridled binge-watching machine. It collects the shows you want to watch in an insanely easy-to-navigate interface and, through the beauty of OnePass, intelligently organizes your carefully managed recordings. Of course, once you do record a show, you'll be able to watch it faster, thanks to features like SkipMode and QuickMode. This means you'll spend more time enjoying your shows and less carefully fast-forwarding through commercial breaks."
b'Setting up additional storage is simple, as is connecting it to a nearby HTPC for Plex.'
b"Finally, TiVo is finally boarding the 4K bandwagon to some surprising results. It tore through Netflix in Ultra-HD, and the company has plans to take on Amazon's 4K catalog in the coming months."
b'We disliked'
b"The TiVo Bolt is definitely lacking when it comes to crucial video streaming apps. While it has Vudu, Amazon and Netflix, it's missing key services, like Showtime Anytime and HBO Now, that would allow cable reductionists to only pay for an antenna and then stream premium content through the apps instead of a paid cable package."
b"Additionally, the TiVo Bolt box comes part and parcel with the monthly service. You'll get the first year of service free when you purchase your system. But payments to the tune of $150 a year, once the free period ends, makes this a tough sell for those looking to save money by cutting the cord."
b'Final verdict'
b"The TiVo Bolt does an admirable job in everything it sets out to do. Not only does it perform as one of the best DVRs on the planet by allowing you to record up to four shows at once, but it completely organizes them in one of the most easy-to-use interfaces. Plus, new features, like SkipMode and QuickMode, will make it so you don't waste hours of your life watching ads that you don't care about."
b"On top of all that, the Bolt is a competent 4K streaming device, tackling Netflix's Ultra-HD library at launch and setting a course for Amazon's offerings next. It could use a few more apps, like HBO Now and Showtime Anytime, to round out the options for cable cutters trying to scale back their cable bill."
b"One problem it can't shake is the monthly fee, though a one-year-free trial helps make the Bolt's $299 and $399 price tag a little more wallet-friendly."
b"If you plan on cutting the cord completely, check out the excellent Roku 4. It lacks a cablecard slot, but offers thousands of channels of streaming content of its own. But ultimately, the Bolt is at the top of the table for TiVo, and it's easily one of the must-own products in the home entertainment category for anyone planning on sticking with cable."

b'Cord-cutting is all the rage, but for many of us, it simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option: there are way too many members of the household that can\xe2\x80\x99t do without TV, you\xe2\x80\x99re too far from the transmitters to get over-the-air TV, the shows you really want to watch aren\xe2\x80\x99t available via streaming, or you really like watching live events you can\xe2\x80\x99t get over-the-air. Whatever the case, cutting the cord is a non-starter. '

b'TiVo Bolt Features & Specs'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt is the sixth and latest generation of TiVo DVR products, and it represents the company\xe2\x80\x99s most comprehensive effort thus far in combining\xc2\xa0a user\xe2\x80\x99s content options into a single interface. TiVo has long approached the activity of watching television a bit differently, from being the first major player to bring\xc2\xa0live TV timeshifting to the mass consumer market to automating the process of recording shows with features like '
b'Season Pass'
b'. Now with TiVo Bolt, the company\xe2\x80\x99s aim is to make finding and enjoying television content as\xc2\xa0simple\xc2\xa0as possible for the consumer, regardless of whether that content is recorded locally via cable or over-the-air, or streamed online via one of several supported video providers.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time that TiVo has offered users access to online content via the TiVo user interface but, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, it\xe2\x80\x99s the company\xe2\x80\x99s most seamless and ambitious push for a \xe2\x80\x9csource-agnostic\xe2\x80\x9d experience yet. As a result, TiVo refers to the Bolt with the marketing-friendly name of \xe2\x80\x9cUnified Entertainment Center.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\n'
b'While the overall experience of the Bolt will be familiar to anyone who has used a TiVo in recent years, the latest device does sport some new and intriguing features.'
b'\n'
b'Supported Online Services:'
b'\n'
b'OneSearch:'
b'Pulp Fiction'
b'? Your TiVo Bolt will let you know that you\xc2\xa0can catch it on HBO at the end of the week, or '
b'watch it right now'

b'OnePass:'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'QuickMode:'
b'Alvin and the Chipmunks'
b'annoyingly padded'
b'\n'
b'SkipMode:'
b'\xc2\xa0SkipMode takes commercial skipping to the next level, for TiVo at least. With SkipMode, users can instantly skip an entire commercial block with a single button press. Hoping to avoid '
b'the issues'
b'\n'
b'Performance Improvements:'
b'\n'
b'From a technical specification standpoint, the TiVo Bolt supports both CableCard and over-the-air sources with four tuners and includes up to 4K video output via its HDMI 2.0 port. Other connectivity options include\xc2\xa0digital\xc2\xa0optical and stereo analog audio outputs for connecting older receivers, gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, two USB 2.0 ports, and an eSATA port for connecting external storage drives.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'There are two official storage capacities available \xe2\x80\x94 '
b'500GB ($199)'
b'1TB ($299)'
b'\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 as well as additional internal and external options from the TiVo specialists over at WeaKnees, such as '
b'this $399 model'
b'\n'
b'The entire TiVo Bolt package is relatively compact when compared to previous TiVo models, at 11.4 inches wide, 7.3-inches deep, 1.8-inches tall, and weighing in at 1.9 pounds.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\xc2\xa0'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The first thing you notice about using the TiVo Bolt is that it is fast. '
b'Super fast'
b'.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt can be purchased in three different options. The '
b'500 GB model'
b'1 TB model'
b'2 TB option'
b'\xc2\xa0from TiVo specialist WeaKnees\xc2\xa0is $399.'
b'\n'
b'The big knock on TiVo as a cord-cutting device is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t free. There is a monthly or annual subscription fee associated with each DVR. There is a new '
b'TiVo Roamio OTA'
b'\n'
b'Installation'
b'\n'
b'The saga of getting our TiVo Bolt up and running wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really anything to do with the device itself, but it was quite an ordeal, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you everything we went through so you have an understanding for what you may be in for if you decide to go the TiVo route. Since Ara, my co-host on the\xc2\xa0'
b'HDTV & Home Theater Podcast'
b', and I are both\xc2\xa0Satellite TV customers, one of us had to get cable activated to do the review. So I\xc2\xa0stopped by a local Cox Solution Store, activated a basic cable package for about $40 per month, added a CableCard for an additional $2 per month and left the store quite satisfied. The whole process took about 15 minutes.'
b'\n'
b'What is supposed to happen is you get home, plug the CableCard into the TiVo, connect the Bolt to coax for cable service and you\xe2\x80\x99re all set. If only that was the case. The first thing that happens is you call the cable provider to pair the CableCard with your account and activate it. This was easy, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. The tuning adapter Cox provided couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lock on, so the Bolt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up any channels. The phone representative suggested a visit from a technician, so we got that scheduled.'
b'\n'
b'The technician arrived the following day and found the signal to the Bolt was both weak and dirty. He did some rewiring, added a signal booster and retested the line. All looked good, everything was green and should have been the perfect situation to get the Bolt working. The tuning adapter did lock on, but the Bolt was permanently stuck at 89% on the process of getting cable channels. A quick call to Cox\xc2\xa0to un-pair and re-pair the CableCard got us past that, and we could then access the program guide, but still received no video. Everything should have been working, but we just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it there.'
b'\n'
b'The Cox technician admitted he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a TiVo expert, but said there were others who were. He would leave for the day and get us connected with a different tech that could hopefully make everything work. That other techs came two days later and found that it was a '
b'PEBKAC issue'
b', '
b'mea culpa'
b'\n'
b'Well, actually, sound was temporary. Not even ten minutes had passed after the second technician had left the house and sound stopped working on the TiVo Bolt. No audio whatsoever. No sound from TV programs, no sound from streaming apps, not sound effects from the TiVo menus. We rebooted the TiVo, unplugged the HDMI, tried a different HDMI input on the TV, nothing worked. '
b'Google to the rescue'
b'. We found '
b'others'
b'\n'
b'About four\xc2\xa0days, three cable\xc2\xa0technicians, several calls to tech support, and a ridiculous number of Google searches later, the TiVo Bolt was finally installed, working and ready for business.'
b'\n'
b'Using the TiVo Bolt'
b'\n'
b'The first thing you notice about using the Bolt is that it is fast. '
b'Super fast'
b'. The user interface doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lag. Searches are crazy fast, and everything just feels like it happens when you want it to. Most DVRs, even the '
b'Hopper'
b'\n'
b'Which leads us to the integration of channel content and streamed content. This functionality, like the\xc2\xa0'
b'OnePass'
b'\n'
b'This unified approach to content is pretty awesome. No more searching through all your video apps to see who has which show. No more wondering if you can get it for free over here or if you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay for it over there. The only weirdness comes in when you set a OnePass for a show like Saturday Night Live, a show with over 40 seasons. For shows with a massive number of past episodes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to adjust the filters to narrow the OnePass results down in order to easily find your recently recorded episodes or a particular set of episodes you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in. It\xe2\x80\x99s two quick button presses, but a bit strange getting used to.'
b'\n'
b'Anytime you switch from one user interface that you\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with to a new one, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a learning curve to get used to it. The TiVo interface is no different, but it is quite intuitive. Everyone in the family picked it up pretty quickly and my\xc2\xa0wife even commented on how much better she thought the experience was than our prior DVR. Sure the guide works a little different, the searches are a bit different, setting recordings is a bit different, but it all makes sense once you get used to it. And what they say is true, TiVo does have the best DVR interface out there. Different, but different in a good way.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'No more wondering if you can Watch an Episode\xc2\xa0for free over here or if you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay for it over there. OnePass on the TiVo Bolt is awesome.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The Bolt also lets you stream recorded content to your phone or tablet if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the same network. You can watch TV from the treadmill, or turn it on from the kitchen, without the need for another box or device. Yes, the Hopper can do that too, but not all DVRs can. And you can control the DVR\xc2\xa0to set and manage recordings\xc2\xa0from anywhere in the world. If you\xe2\x80\x99re outside the home you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stream content directly from your device, but the TiVo app will still helpfully\xc2\xa0tell you if the show you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is available via any streaming services, information\xc2\xa0you can then use\xc2\xa0to catch up on your favorite shows via third party services in\xc2\xa0lieu of streaming the recordings directly from your home Bolt.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'There are a couple nits about the TiVo Bolt, though. Parental controls on the Bolt are a bit weak. It feels like they threw something in to say they had it, not really designing the feature to match what parents would want to do. If you have a lot of kids all accessing the same DVR for content, it would be nice to have a bit more granularity on what you can do.'
b'\n'
b'Another issue is that a lot of the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s menus don\xe2\x80\x99t wrap around. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the top option and want to get to the bottom, you have to scroll through all the options to get there, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just click the up button once. Same if you\xe2\x80\x99re at the bottom and want to get to the top. If you try to do it, the Bolt makes an error sound. Admittedly not a huge deal, but strange.'
b'\n'
b'TiVo Bolt Accessories'
b'\n'
b'Like competing DVR services offered directly from the cable and satellite companies, TiVo offers a number of accessories to enhance or expand a user\xe2\x80\x99s TiVo experience at home and on the go.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The '
b'TiVo Mini'
b'add a video zone'
b'. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require an additional subscription, just buy the box and away you go. It can be installed using wired Ethernet or '
b'MoCA'
b'. So if you have a coax cable but no ethernet, you\xe2\x80\x99re still good. If you have neither, you\xe2\x80\x99re stuck, as the TiVo Mini cannot be used via Wi-Fi. That\xe2\x80\x99s a huge bummer for those who like the wireless options from Dish or AT&T. But we were able to get one working using a pair of '
b'500MB Powerline Ethernet adapters'
b'\n'
b'Most cable and satellite companies charge a monthly fee for the extender boxes. Dish calls them '
b'Joeys'
b', and they can run from $8 to $12 per month. With the Mini there is no additional monthly cost at all. Using $10 per month as an average, you break even on the Mini after about 14 months. Keep in mind that the Bolt only has four tuners, so you have an upper bound on the number of Minis you can functionally add. Supposedly you can get two Bolts working at the same time to get 8 tuners in the home, but right now they manage recordings totally independently. Internet rumors claim Tivo is working on a unified view for multiple Bolts, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to corroborate that claim.'

b'TiVo Stream'
b'Slingbox'
b'. If you have one, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t need the other. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Slingbox and want to watch TV from outside the home, TiVo Stream gets you that. There are some limitations, though. According to a Q&A at Amazon, \xe2\x80\x9cit allows out of home streaming, but only if the content provider allows it.\xe2\x80\x9d The major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), Viacom (Comedy Central, MTV), and Discovery (TLC, Science) all BLOCK streaming, so the TiVo Stream does not stream or allow the transfer of shows to another device.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\n'
b'Conclusion'
b'\n'
b'TiVo is pretty freaking great. For those who want to cut and or '

b'\n                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.

BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.\n                    '

b'I just called Tivo and got my replacement Tivo Remote Control for FREE! Woohoo!\n\nI have an old Tivo HD box that I have for years. My old HD Tivo still works great, but I can\'t say the same for the remote control. I probably dropped it on the floor too many times and it finally died. I thought I would have to buy it on ebay and see how much I need to spend for the replacement (looks to be about $25-$30). But before I made the purchase online, I begin to wonder if any Tivo remote will even work for my old TiVo Box so I went online to Tivo.com and chat an online support. I was told the new remotes that they have for sale will not work on my old Tivo box and that I should call TiVo sales for further assistance. I\'m so glad I didn\'t make any purchase right away before checking to be sure.\n\nI was thinking, why not, let me call and see how much it will cost for a replacement Tivo remote control, then compare the price from online. After talking to the sales agent and answer some secure questions so that they can look up what Tivo box I have. He then said he will mail the remote to me. I was surprised, confirming with the agent, "for FREE?", and got a reply, "Yes, no charge". I was so thrill to hear it, I saved $25-30 that can go toward foods!\n\nThank you Tivo! You made me a fan again!'

b"About a month ago a Tivo sales rep told me they had a Promo upgrading me from my Tivo premiere with life time to a new Tivo Bolt with lifetime transferring my lifetime service, so I said great sign me up and paid for the promo.  The Tivo Bolts were back ordered so I waited and a few days ago I got the Bolt in and went to hook it up today, but it's asked me activate it. It was asking for a service plan, wait what so I called Tivo and this is what I was told.. Yes we see notes on your account that the rep sold you a unit with those terms, but we can't honor it since no promo exists like that for upgrading a Tivo premiere with service transfer to a Bolt. So I said but that not my fault your rep told me about the promo and now your not honoring it, instead they offered to reduce the life time service to 350.00 on top of what I paid for the bolt. I have been a customer since Tivo started as a customer, so there was no misunderstanding and the notes on my account even states the deal and my email reciept and now I am told they won't honor the deal to transfer lifetime to my bolt which I am now returning..\n\nIt was asking for a service plan, wait what so I called Tivo and this is what I was told..\n\nYes we see notes on your account that the rep sold you a unit with those terms, but we can't honor it since no promo exists like that for upgrading a Tivo premiere with service transfer to a Bolt.

b"TiVo.. What happened to you? You used to be the greatest thing. I started with you in 2000 and your product was great. 10 days ago I opened a support ticket. Zero response other than the automated reply.\n\nFirst, opening a ticket when I am logged into your support site should not require me to enter data that you already have. Allow me to choose from data you already have such as my name, address, etc. Please, make it easy for those of us paying for your service, your salary and your shareholders.\n\nSecond, today I contacted support... again, having to enter a lot of data just to get to a support person. When I do reach the person, she (Jennifer) asked me to enter info that I had already entered. And then didn't believe me and had me go to the TiVo box to tell her a third time. Same Data. Really?\n\nVery long waits between her responses. Very poor response. I strongly recommend you go to Amazon.com, order a Tivo device, find a problem with it, try to get support from your own site, and then return it to Amazon and tell me which support experience is 1,000 times easier and customer-focused. Then tell me which company you want to do business with.\n\nAt the end of the support chat, the dialog box offered a customer survey. I clicked to start the survey and the box closed... no survey and no way for me to communicate my experience. I am left with no other option than to stop buying TiVo equipment (planning to upgrade to a TiVo Bolt in January) and search for another solution for my TV needs.\n\nIf we want to discuss User Experience, let's look at the interface. I've paid for my TiVo and I pay for your monthly guide (yes, I still pay monthly). You have added more apps (iheart radio? don't need it) and they push the apps I do use further down making it more time consuming each time I want to use the device. Less fun. I just ordered Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV devices and both allow me to adjust apps to where I want them...\n\nIt's sad for me to say, but the TiVos that I have loved are in the past, and as a line of products and as a support organization, you are getting way behind. Not only are you losing the TVs in my home, but in the homes of the family members and friends that I support and have directed towards your products in recent years.\n\nThank you, it was fun while it lasted... if you want to fix these issues, I'd be willing to consider returning, but you'll now have competition for my $$."

b"Have had lineup issues since moving to San Diego 6 months ago.  I have mad over 30 calls to TiVo tech support and their executive resolution team.  At one point I had someone following up with me regularly but no corrections were ever made and then they just stopped calling.  I have called in several more times to re-open the case but I just get an overseas tech support rep who wants to follow their script and start with resetting my box.  The customer service staff are just robots, you explain what you need help with and they repeat it back to you...and thats about it...they don't use what you explained to troubleshoot the problem...they just repeat what you said and then start their script.  I have asked for a refund and been told no, I have tried to cancel and I go around and around with he rep trying to talk me out of cancelling but will not listen that the lineup is broken so I won't pay for something that does not work.  Three attempts to cancel and I was on the phone for 40 minutes each time, finally I just hang up because I can't stand arguing any more.  Such awful service and it didn't use to be this way.  When their agents were U.S. based it was excellent service."

b"TiVo is turning out to be just like all the Cable providers!  Rotten!  I spoke with Dina yesterday to renew a contract with TiVo and we worked for 30 minutes to restore service.  Gave her my cc info-told me it would take 24 hours to reset.  24 hours later nothing!  Called TiVo and spoke to Will who was so nice and so sorry this happened.  He went to a mgr to get help and he told me he was sorry but Dina didn't complete the work she said she'd do.  Will told me it would take another 24 hours to restore and I asked him to speak to his manager again to escalate the issue.  He came back and told me it would now take an hour.  One hour later...of course it didn't get restored.  By now they are closed for the night and I have to wait another day to speak to someone that probably won't help me!  My confidence in TiVo has plunged!  Please help me TiVo!"

b"Long long time customer and I was thinking of adding another unit to my home. Called today and after a long wait finally got ahold of one of the sales guys. He really did not give me very much info to go on, so after a frustrating conversation I gave up. \n   Later I thought lets call tech support and they will surly be able to help with my more techy questions. But to my surprise, I was talking to an Over seas operator. TIVO has NEVER has off shore call centers. but I guess they do now. It to for ever to get transfered back to the USA And when I finally did, I was so upset as I just was always so proud of TIVO for not bailing and sending jobs off shore. And when I tried to call the corporate office the receptionest told me that I had not called Corporate but later said that I had. Please whoever bought out this company please fix it back to what it was in the past. I can't keep supporting this bad customer service."

b'We have used TiVo for over a decade. Service and customer service used to be great! That is no longer the case.  We are on our 3rd TiVo since August- as our unit we bought a year and a half ago died and the unit sent after that did not work. During this time we have been without consistent service and TiVo has been double charging us in the meantime. Customer service calls and surveys and even emails are not responded to and the reps that we do speak to are not sympathetic and powerless to resolve our problem. \n\nHow something so great has gone so horribly wrong is a mystery but in the meantime we are going to discontinue service.'

b"A year ago, I disconnected from satellite, for good.  \n\nTivo's product and especially their service has been amazing:\n*purchase the lifetime service, totally worth every penny, no monthly service charges for the life of your box?  WOW.\n*don't purchase the warranty, they desire to retain their customer, call them and they will probably make it happen and keep you satisfied \n\nHATE the remote, but I paid a ONE time fee for years of entertainment.  Just a year of satellite is DOUBLE the price of the equipment and lifetime service.  \n\nLove my streaming shows.  Who has time to watch all that TV?  I realized, I sure don't."

b'I purchased a TIVO with a lifetime subscription, so no further payments are required. But TIVO insists that I give them a credit card number. There explanation is that we want it.  I love the tiro system but the company sucks.  there is no reason to require a credit card except to invade people privacy. If you do not have a credit card their suggestion is " get someone else to let them use theirs"  What a great (idiotic) idea.'

b'My wife and I recently moved into a new home with her elderly parents.  Our goal was to minimize expenses for all of us while giving them a sense of security for their near future.\n\nThis home is in Time Warner/ Verizon Fios territory and we had the choice of either.  As past customer\'s of DirectTV, we knew we had that choice as well.  Our past experience with Time Warner was not *awesome* and our past experience with DirectTV was good but expensive.\n\nNone of us had ever owned Tivo\'s.\n\nWhen comparing the Time Warner/ DirectTV / Verizon Fios pricing packages for the stations we consider most essential, we were quickly floored by the sticker shock cost of lighting up 5 TVs with DVR service.  Across the board, we were looking at ~$250 per month with the internet service I need for my work.\n\nSo we looked into Tivo.  Tivo had just released their new Bolt DVR, and they have remote devices called "Minis" that can use the tuners in the Bolts.  Bolts have four tuners each for both watching TV and recording it.\n\nVerizon had the best internet packages and we ultimately decided to get their 150MB/150MB internet service plus TV programming that suited our needs.  \n\nUsing the Tivo\'s requires getting Cable Cards (slide in encryption devices) to access cable channels.  At Verizon, these are about $5 per month.  We ordered three for two Tivo Bolt\'s and one for a Silicon Dust HD Homerun Prime streamer for our computers and laptops.\n\nSo now we had 8 tuners to distribute to 5 TVs from the Tivos (I am the only one that ever uses the three Silicon Dust tuners.)  This saved us almost $100 in Verizon set top box rental and DVR service charges.  This is somewhat offset by the Tivo $150 per year ($30 per month) subscription charges for the two Bolts and the $15 in monthly Cable Card rental.\n\nIn the end, we were able to calculate a 23 month ROI on the Tivo box purchases over renting set top boxes and DVR service from Verizon.\n\nBut this is not for the technically faint hearted.  We worked through multiple problems mostly related to the speed of our local ethernet network (1GB, but local cables that were less than CAT6 posed problems), and the speed of our coaxial network (less than RG6 local cables posed problems).  I also found we needed to terminate unused coaxial cable connections with appropriate 75 ohm terminators.\n\nOne of our original Bolt\'s had a tuning problem, which took about two weeks to work out with Tivo support.  Tivo support was great, but could not grasp that with two Bolts, one had tuning problems and the other did not on the same cables and in the same location.  I had to replace the Cable Card to prove to them that the Bolt was having problems.\n\nAs to the Tivo experience, it is without peer.  We love the streaming apps + TV tuner capabilities and the Minis expand to our 5 TVs in an economical way that just makes sense.  We have the in-laws sharing their own Bolt for the Living room and their bedroom and sharing that Bolt with the guest bedroom.  My wife and I share the other Bolt between the Family Room and our bedroom.\n\nAfter some hiccups with getting speeds to their maximums on our Ethernet, WiFi, and Coaxial networks, we now have a very accommodating system for all involved.  It is amazing to see my father in law binging on TV show marathons in Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. On the plus side, Tivo\'s support remote streaming from Sources like Youtube making it possible to share family videos on your TVs.  \n\nThe search feature is the killer, it will search from both TV programs in your scheduled programming and streaming apps you have subscribed to.  I have never seen better except perhaps in my Roku which is less convenient and out of the current input channel when using the TV tuner.\n\nSo mission accomplished but make sure you are ready for getting all networks, local cables, and required terminations up to speed.  It has been worth it, but it required more work than I expected.  Also, know that Tivo support is real slow to assign fault to their own equipment.  If you need replacements, you may be in for a long haul.'

b"Bought a new TIVO Bolt 2 months ago because one of my TIVO boxes was tiling premium channels.  Guess what the new TIVO BOLT was even worse.  Fast forward 2 months, after countless calls to TIVO and Comcast it still doesn't work.  Comcast came out 3 times, 2 times with a supervisor and ran every diagnostic in the world on the TIVO and cable system.. All new cables were put it.  We even ran the working TIVO cable to the defective TIVO and it still didn't  work.  TIVO finally agreed to send a new TIVO Bolt.  Today I got a notice saying that it would be a refurbished BOLT.  I have now been on the phone with a TIVO supervisor for over an hour with no budging on their part.  I have been a TIVO customer for eight years.  It is time to junk the whole system.  Worst customer service ever, agent who don't what they are doing."

b'I had Tivo DVR a dozen years ago and loved it!  In the meantime, I have had to deal with mediocre DVR\'s and associated software with U-verse, Dish & Direct TV.  With an anticipated move to a new house, I decided to purchase a Tivo DVR directly from them and get back to the user friendly system I use to love.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a story about a dysfunctional order/sales system.  I tried to purchase a Roamio Plus DVR, lifetime subscription service & a mini box for around $1,000.  When they placed the order, something went wrong with their order software system, which authorized a charge to my debit card, but the order "died" internally giving the customer service representation an "error message".  I was asked if I would be willing to allow a second authorization of my debit card, but this too failed.  I had been on the phone for about an hour, being put on hold on and off, when I was cut off.\n\nI assumed that the order was somehow placed and all was good.  The next day two more charge authorizations came through on my debit card, now totally some $4,000 in pending charges.  I only found out about the additional charges by looking at my account on-line.  These charges overdrew my account and I had to transfer $2,000 to cover this amount.  It took me another 3 hours on the phone talking to Tivo and my bank to resolve this $4,000 debacle, finally removing all these charges, which had no orders behind them.\n\nThe Tivo customer  service representative I was working with on day 3 of the mess, a Friday, suggested I use another account, which I did, but the error on their order system occurred for the 5th time.  She told me that she would manually enter the order and that I would receive an e-mail confirmation.\n\nOn Monday, I still had not received an e-mail conformation, so I called Tivo, to find that the same thing happened as on all the other orders; an error message occurred, but nobody followed up on it, nobody "manually" entered an order and I have a pending $1,000 charge on my other debit card.  Very poor customer service.\n\nThe last customer service supervisor I talked with, finally suggested I buy a Tivo from "Best Buy" and then Tivo would reimburse any price difference to me, so that I would have my unit in time for the cable guy visit on the upcoming Friday.  I\'m off to "Best Buy".  Wish me luck.\n\nAll through these six days of trying to buy something, I was explained to, told about and reasoned with how their "order system" was not working.  At the very end, I had to explain to the supervisor that we as customers don\'t care what their order software problems are.  We just want to buy their stuff.  I cannot believe that they cannot manually place an order, but they could take my money.\n\nIf it was me, having been in manufacturing, production & quality assurance for 25 years, I would have personally packaged the hardware and personally walked it to FedEx and have it shipped "next day".  Then I\'d get back to the customer as to paying for the equipment.  I mean I was a good risk.  I had committed $5,000 of my money towards the purchase of $1,000 worth of goods from Tivo.  Customer loyalty is a very tenuous thing.  Hopefully, I will love my new Tivo, otherwise .....'

b'BUYER BEWARE!!!  When I called TIVO to set up service, I said I "want to try you out." The rep answered, "Then you\'ll want our month-to-month service."  THIS IS MISLEADING AND A DOWNRIGHT LIE. I cancelled after 4 months and was slapped with a $75 cancellation fee and was told that the "month-to-month is actually a one-year contract," something that was not told to me when I started service. \n\nBOO.

b'I was a longtime TIVO subscriber and happy with their service.  In July, 2015 we had a house fire.  We were displaced for a year and our TIVO box was a casualty of the fire.  I called TIVO and explained the situation and cancelled our service as the box was destroyed.  In October 2015, without notice, TIVO resumed billing for the destroyed box.  The box that I told them no longer existed.  I just recently noticed the charge.  OK, human error on their part - I\'ll call and fix this.  Well, their response was that this problem was a "shared responsibility."  Essentially, even though I called, told them the box was destroyed and cancelled my TIVO service - that I should be on the lookout for TIVO just deciding to start billing me again.  While I agree that I should check my credit card bills more carefully - I also believe that I should be able to trust a company when I call and cancel a service.  After the fire I canceled many home-related services (cable, phone, garbage, etc.) and none of them resumed billing prematurely.  Sheesh - even Comcast was more ethical than TIVO.  Thumbs down.  No ethics.'

b'Service over the 5-6 years that I had tivo stagnated and cable companies eclipsed Tivo..  \n\nWhen time came to cancel the service, they offered to "suspend" my billing so I can try and sell the Series 3 HD equipment... \n\nI tired, but I could not even give it away for FREE!\nI cancelled the service in July of 2015, But, Tivo conveniently kept on billing me every month automatically against my checking account..\n\n8 Months later, I am realizing they are still stealing my money after cancellation AND confirmation emails stating it was cancelled..  \n\nSo, I called them today explaining that they have been fraudently charging my account for 8 months..  The "specalist" on the case said, sorry, they can only refund me 90 days... \n\nI\'m like, WHAT??  You have been stealing money from my bank account systematicaly for 8 MONTHS!!! And you claim I can only get 90 days worth???\n\nThis company is beyond corrupt..\n\nAfter 15 minutes of transferring and talking to more "specialists" and supervisors, eventually the agent, after threathing them with reporting fraud and theft, she goes: "Ok, looks like we forgot to click the cancel button when you called in March.. we\'ll refund your money"\n\nRUN..RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!'

b"Tivo used to have reasonable customer service.  Now it sucks.  Called and was told the wait time was approximately 20 minutes.  After 2 HOURS on hold I gave up.  Their website was not only NOT helpful with my issue but it provided ABSOLUTELY WRONG information/solution.  However, the hardware/product remains great . . . Just hope and pray you don't need customer support because you might die of old age before you get it."

b'I have a TIVO device that I rent via my cable company for $20/month (plus $10 for the mini). The system seems to work very well though it has a few things I do not enjoy like having to delete each and every program one at a time twice. Some of the menus take time to learn. \n\nMy complaint and low rating is based on the potential purchasing of a TIVO.\nI would advise anyone who wants to purchase one to make sure you understand what you are paying for prior to purchase.. \n\n1. The $500 lifetime service agreement only applies to the actual unit you purchase.\nIf the unit goes into service and it is deemed by them it needs to be replaced the service agreement ends! This means you have to purchase another service agreement for the replacement unit if you want one.\n\n2. Even if you purchase a warranty it does not cover all labor and parts in certain circumstances and you must pay for a replacement. You also have to pay for transportation costs.\n\nAfter speaking to the TIVO agents I came to the conclusion if TIVO will not fix their equipment at no cost under warranty due to component failures 100% and will not make the service agreement continue to units they replace at no additional fee it is best to not purchase the device and service.'

b'Anyone with the series III TiVo received an on screen message on Friday, April 3. The message in your TiVo display said "the Amazon and YouTube applications will not be available on this DVR as of April 16, 2015. You will not be able to purchase or download titles from Amazon on this DVR. However, you will be able to continue to watch the movies/TV episodes you purchased an already downloaded within the now playing list."\n\n I contacted TiVo and was told that this was a decision mutually agreed upon by Amazon and TiVo.  TiVo stated that both Amazon and TiVo I had upgraded their software and elected to leave  thousands of series III tiVo customers behind. \n\n As a TiVo subscriber with a lifetime subscription and also as an Amazon prime customer this truly sucks.'

b"I would give 0 stars if I could.  I bought a romeo box from tivo that didn't work from day one.  Was suppose to be new but I think it was refurbished.  When I called to return box for credit.  They told me they would not do that.  Their customer service sucks.  Better ways to cut the cord than using tivo.  Table or magna vox new 1tb machine with no monthly fees."

b'I just called Tivo and got my replacement Tivo Remote Control for FREE! Woohoo!'
b"I have an old Tivo HD box that I have for years. My old HD Tivo still works great, but I can't say the same for the remote control. I probably dropped it on the floor too many times and it finally died. I thought I would have to buy it on ebay and see how much I need to spend for the replacement (looks to be about $25-$30). But before I made the purchase online, I begin to wonder if any Tivo remote will even work for my old TiVo Box so I went online to "
b'tivo.com'
b'I was thinking, why not, let me call and see how much it will cost for a replacement Tivo remote control, then compare the price from online. After talking to the sales agent and answer some secure questions so that they can look up what Tivo box I have. He then said he will mail the remote to me. I was surprised, confirming with the agent, "for FREE?", and got a reply, "Yes, no charge". I was so thrill to hear it, I saved $25-30 that can go toward foods!'
b'Thank you Tivo! You made me a fan again!'

b"About a month ago a Tivo sales rep told me they had a Promo upgrading me from my Tivo premiere with life time to a new Tivo Bolt with lifetime transferring my lifetime service, so I said great sign me up and paid for the promo. \xc2\xa0The Tivo Bolts were back ordered so I waited and a few days ago I got the Bolt in and went to hook it up today, but it's asked me activate it. It was asking for a service plan, wait what so I called Tivo and this is what I was told.. Yes we see notes on your account that the rep sold you a unit with those terms, but we can't honor it since no promo exists like that for upgrading a Tivo premiere with service transfer to a Bolt. So I said but that not my fault your rep told me about the promo and now your not honoring it, instead they offered to reduce the life time service to 350.00 on top of what I paid for the bolt. I have been a customer since Tivo started as a customer, so there was no misunderstanding and the notes on my account even states the deal and my email reciept and now I am told they won't honor the deal to transfer lifetime to my bolt which I am now returning.."

b'TiVo.. What happened to you? You used to be the greatest thing. I started with you in 2000 and your product was great. 10 days ago I opened a support ticket. Zero response other than the automated reply.'
b'First, opening a ticket when I am logged into your support site should not require me to enter data that you already have. Allow me to choose from data you already have such as my name, address, etc. Please, make it easy for those of us paying for your service, your salary and your shareholders.'
b"Second, today I contacted support... again, having to enter a lot of data just to get to a support person. When I do reach the person, she (Jennifer) asked me to enter info that I had already entered. And then didn't believe me and had me go to the TiVo box to tell her a third time. Same Data. Really?"
b'Very long waits between her responses. Very poor response. I strongly recommend you go to '
b'amazon.com'
b', order a Tivo device, find a problem with it, try to get support from your own site, and then return it to Amazon and tell me which support experience is 1,000 times easier and customer-focused. Then tell me which company you want to do business with.'
b'At the end of the support chat, the dialog box offered a customer survey. I clicked to start the survey and the box closed... no survey and no way for me to communicate my experience. I am left with no other option than to stop buying TiVo equipment (planning to upgrade to a TiVo Bolt in January) and search for another solution for my TV needs.'
b"If we want to discuss User Experience, let's look at the interface. I've paid for my TiVo and I pay for your monthly guide (yes, I still pay monthly). You have added more apps (iheart radio? don't need it) and they push the apps I do use further down making it more time consuming each time I want to use the device. Less fun. I just ordered Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV devices and both allow me to adjust apps to where I want them..."
b"It's sad for me to say, but the TiVos that I have loved are in the past, and as a line of products and as a support organization, you are getting way behind. Not only are you losing the TVs in my home, but in the homes of the family members and friends that I support and have directed towards your products in recent years."
b"Thank you, it was fun while it lasted... if you want to fix these issues, I'd be willing to consider returning, but you'll now have competition for my $$."

b"Have had lineup issues since moving to San Diego 6 months ago. \xc2\xa0I have mad over 30 calls to TiVo tech support and their executive resolution team. \xc2\xa0At one point I had someone following up with me regularly but no corrections were ever made and then they just stopped calling. \xc2\xa0I have called in several more times to re-open the case but I just get an overseas tech support rep who wants to follow their script and start with resetting my box. \xc2\xa0The customer service staff are just robots, you explain what you need help with and they repeat it back to you...and thats about it...they don't use what you explained to troubleshoot the problem...they just repeat what you said and then start their script. \xc2\xa0I have asked for a refund and been told no, I have tried to cancel and I go around and around with he rep trying to talk me out of cancelling but will not listen that the lineup is broken so I won't pay for something that does not work. \xc2\xa0Three attempts to cancel and I was on the phone for 40 minutes each time, finally I just hang up because I can't stand arguing any more. \xc2\xa0Such awful service and it didn't use to be this way. \xc2\xa0When their agents were U.S. based it was excellent service."

b"TiVo is turning out to be just like all the Cable providers! \xc2\xa0Rotten! \xc2\xa0I spoke with Dina yesterday to renew a contract with TiVo and we worked for 30 minutes to restore service. \xc2\xa0Gave her my cc info-told me it would take 24 hours to reset. \xc2\xa024 hours later nothing! \xc2\xa0Called TiVo and spoke to Will who was so nice and so sorry this happened. \xc2\xa0He went to a mgr to get help and he told me he was sorry but Dina didn't complete the work she said she'd do. \xc2\xa0Will told me it would take another 24 hours to restore and I asked him to speak to his manager again to escalate the issue. \xc2\xa0He came back and told me it would now take an hour. \xc2\xa0One hour later...of course it didn't get restored. \xc2\xa0By now they are closed for the night and I have to wait another day to speak to someone that probably won't help me! \xc2\xa0My confidence in TiVo has plunged! \xc2\xa0Please help me TiVo!"

b'Long long time customer and I was thinking of adding another unit to my home. Called today and after a long wait finally got ahold of one of the sales guys. He really did not give me very much info to go on, so after a frustrating conversation I gave up. '

b'We have used TiVo for over a decade. Service and customer service used to be great! That is no longer the case. \xc2\xa0We are on our 3rd TiVo since August- as our unit we bought a year and a half ago died and the unit sent after that did not work. During this time we have been without consistent service and TiVo has been double charging us in the meantime. Customer service calls and surveys and even emails are not responded to and the reps that we do speak to are not sympathetic and powerless to resolve our problem. '
b'How something so great has gone so horribly wrong is a mystery but in the meantime we are going to discontinue service.'

b"Tivo's product and especially their service has been amazing:"
b'HATE the remote, but I paid a ONE time fee for years of entertainment. \xc2\xa0Just a year of satellite is DOUBLE the price of the equipment and lifetime service. \xc2\xa0'

b'I purchased a TIVO with a lifetime subscription, so no further payments are required. But TIVO insists that I give them a credit card number. There explanation is that we want it. \xc2\xa0I love the tiro system but the company sucks. \xc2\xa0there is no reason to require a credit card except to invade people privacy. If you do not have a credit card their suggestion is " get someone else to let them use theirs" \xc2\xa0What a great (idiotic) idea.'

b'My wife and I recently moved into a new home with her elderly parents. \xc2\xa0Our goal was to minimize expenses for all of us while giving them a sense of security for their near future.'
b"This home is in Time Warner/ Verizon Fios territory and we had the choice of either. \xc2\xa0As past customer's of DirectTV, we knew we had that choice as well. \xc2\xa0Our past experience with Time Warner was not *awesome* and our past experience with DirectTV was good but expensive."
b"None of us had ever owned Tivo's."
b'When comparing the Time Warner/ DirectTV / Verizon Fios pricing packages for the stations we consider most essential, we were quickly floored by the sticker shock cost of lighting up 5 TVs with DVR service. \xc2\xa0Across the board, we were looking at ~$250 per month with the internet service I need for my work.'
b'So we looked into Tivo. \xc2\xa0Tivo had just released their new Bolt DVR, and they have remote devices called "Minis" that can use the tuners in the Bolts. \xc2\xa0Bolts have four tuners each for both watching TV and recording it.'
b'Verizon had the best internet packages and we ultimately decided to get their 150MB/150MB internet service plus TV programming that suited our needs. \xc2\xa0'
b"Using the Tivo's requires getting Cable Cards (slide in encryption devices) to access cable channels. \xc2\xa0At Verizon, these are about $5 per month. \xc2\xa0We ordered three for two Tivo Bolt's and one for a Silicon Dust HD Homerun Prime streamer for our computers and laptops."
b'So now we had 8 tuners to distribute to 5 TVs from the Tivos (I am the only one that ever uses the three Silicon Dust tuners.) \xc2\xa0This saved us almost $100 in Verizon set top box rental and DVR service charges. \xc2\xa0This is somewhat offset by the Tivo $150 per year ($30 per month) subscription charges for the two Bolts and the $15 in monthly Cable Card rental.'
b'In the end, we were able to calculate a 23 month ROI on the Tivo box purchases over renting set top boxes and DVR service from Verizon.'
b'But this is not for the technically faint hearted. \xc2\xa0We worked through multiple problems mostly related to the speed of our local ethernet network (1GB, but local cables that were less than CAT6 posed problems), and the speed of our coaxial network (less than RG6 local cables posed problems). \xc2\xa0I also found we needed to terminate unused coaxial cable connections with appropriate 75 ohm terminators.'
b"One of our original Bolt's had a tuning problem, which took about two weeks to work out with Tivo support. \xc2\xa0Tivo support was great, but could not grasp that with two Bolts, one had tuning problems and the other did not on the same cables and in the same location. \xc2\xa0I had to replace the Cable Card to prove to them that the Bolt was having problems."
b'As to the Tivo experience, it is without peer. \xc2\xa0We love the streaming apps + TV tuner capabilities and the Minis expand to our 5 TVs in an economical way that just makes sense. \xc2\xa0We have the in-laws sharing their own Bolt for the Living room and their bedroom and sharing that Bolt with the guest bedroom. \xc2\xa0My wife and I share the other Bolt between the Family Room and our bedroom.'
b"After some hiccups with getting speeds to their maximums on our Ethernet, WiFi, and Coaxial networks, we now have a very accommodating system for all involved. \xc2\xa0It is amazing to see my father in law binging on TV show marathons in Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. On the plus side, Tivo's support remote streaming from Sources like Youtube making it possible to share family videos on your TVs. \xc2\xa0"
b'The search feature is the killer, it will search from both TV programs in your scheduled programming and streaming apps you have subscribed to. \xc2\xa0I have never seen better except perhaps in my Roku which is less convenient and out of the current input channel when using the TV tuner.'
b'So mission accomplished but make sure you are ready for getting all networks, local cables, and required terminations up to speed. \xc2\xa0It has been worth it, but it required more work than I expected. \xc2\xa0Also, know that Tivo support is real slow to assign fault to their own equipment. \xc2\xa0If you need replacements, you may be in for a long haul.'

b"Bought a new TIVO Bolt 2 months ago because one of my TIVO boxes was tiling premium channels. \xc2\xa0Guess what the new TIVO BOLT was even worse. \xc2\xa0Fast forward 2 months, after countless calls to TIVO and Comcast it still doesn't work. \xc2\xa0Comcast came out 3 times, 2 times with a supervisor and ran every diagnostic in the world on the TIVO and cable system.. All new cables were put it. \xc2\xa0We even ran the working TIVO cable to the defective TIVO and it still didn't \xc2\xa0work. \xc2\xa0TIVO finally agreed to send a new TIVO Bolt. \xc2\xa0Today I got a notice saying that it would be a refurbished BOLT. \xc2\xa0I have now been on the phone with a TIVO supervisor for over an hour with no budging on their part. \xc2\xa0I have been a TIVO customer for eight years. \xc2\xa0It is time to junk the whole system. \xc2\xa0Worst customer service ever, agent who don't what they are doing."

b"I had Tivo DVR a dozen years ago and loved it! \xc2\xa0In the meantime, I have had to deal with mediocre DVR's and associated software with U-verse, Dish & Direct TV. \xc2\xa0With an anticipated move to a new house, I decided to purchase a Tivo DVR directly from them and get back to the user friendly system I use to love."
b'Unfortunately, this is a story about a dysfunctional order/sales system. \xc2\xa0I tried to purchase a Roamio Plus DVR, lifetime subscription service & a mini box for around $1,000. \xc2\xa0When they placed the order, something went wrong with their order software system, which authorized a charge to my debit card, but the order "died" internally giving the customer service representation an "error message". \xc2\xa0I was asked if I would be willing to allow a second authorization of my debit card, but this too failed. \xc2\xa0I had been on the phone for about an hour, being put on hold on and off, when I was cut off.'
b'I assumed that the order was somehow placed and all was good. \xc2\xa0The next day two more charge authorizations came through on my debit card, now totally some $4,000 in pending charges. \xc2\xa0I only found out about the additional charges by looking at my account on-line. \xc2\xa0These charges overdrew my account and I had to transfer $2,000 to cover this amount. \xc2\xa0It took me another 3 hours on the phone talking to Tivo and my bank to resolve this $4,000 debacle, finally removing all these charges, which had no orders behind them.'
b'The Tivo customer \xc2\xa0service representative I was working with on day 3 of the mess, a Friday, suggested I use another account, which I did, but the error on their order system occurred for the 5th time. \xc2\xa0She told me that she would manually enter the order and that I would receive an e-mail confirmation.'
b'On Monday, I still had not received an e-mail conformation, so I called Tivo, to find that the same thing happened as on all the other orders; an error message occurred, but nobody followed up on it, nobody "manually" entered an order and I have a pending $1,000 charge on my other debit card. \xc2\xa0Very poor customer service.'
b'The last customer service supervisor I talked with, finally suggested I buy a Tivo from "Best Buy" and then Tivo would reimburse any price difference to me, so that I would have my unit in time for the cable guy visit on the upcoming Friday. \xc2\xa0I\'m off to "Best Buy". \xc2\xa0Wish me luck.'
b'All through these six days of trying to buy something, I was explained to, told about and reasoned with how their "order system" was not working. \xc2\xa0At the very end, I had to explain to the supervisor that we as customers don\'t care what their order software problems are. \xc2\xa0We just want to buy their stuff. \xc2\xa0I cannot believe that they cannot manually place an order, but they could take my money.'
b'If it was me, having been in manufacturing, production & quality assurance for 25 years, I would have personally packaged the hardware and personally walked it to FedEx and have it shipped "next day". \xc2\xa0Then I\'d get back to the customer as to paying for the equipment. \xc2\xa0I mean I was a good risk. \xc2\xa0I had committed $5,000 of my money towards the purchase of $1,000 worth of goods from Tivo. \xc2\xa0Customer loyalty is a very tenuous thing. \xc2\xa0Hopefully, I will love my new Tivo, otherwise .....'

b'BUYER BEWARE!!! \xc2\xa0When I called TIVO to set up service, I said I "want to try you out." The rep answered, "Then you\'ll want our month-to-month service." \xc2\xa0THIS IS MISLEADING AND A DOWNRIGHT LIE. I cancelled after 4 months and was slapped with a $75 cancellation fee and was told that the "month-to-month is actually a one-year contract," something that was not told to me when I started service.

b'I was a longtime TIVO subscriber and happy with their service. \xc2\xa0In July, 2015 we had a house fire. \xc2\xa0We were displaced for a year and our TIVO box was a casualty of the fire. \xc2\xa0I called TIVO and explained the situation and cancelled our service as the box was destroyed. \xc2\xa0In October 2015, without notice, TIVO resumed billing for the destroyed box. \xc2\xa0The box that I told them no longer existed. \xc2\xa0I just recently noticed the charge. \xc2\xa0OK, human error on their part - I\'ll call and fix this. \xc2\xa0Well, their response was that this problem was a "shared responsibility." \xc2\xa0Essentially, even though I called, told them the box was destroyed and cancelled my TIVO service - that I should be on the lookout for TIVO just deciding to start billing me again. \xc2\xa0While I agree that I should check my credit card bills more carefully - I also believe that I should be able to trust a company when I call and cancel a service. \xc2\xa0After the fire I canceled many home-related services (cable, phone, garbage, etc.) and none of them resumed billing prematurely. \xc2\xa0Sheesh - even Comcast was more ethical than TIVO. \xc2\xa0Thumbs down. \xc2\xa0No ethics.'

b'Service over the 5-6 years that I had tivo stagnated and cable companies eclipsed Tivo.. \xc2\xa0'
b'When time came to cancel the service, they offered to "suspend" my billing so I can try and sell the Series 3 HD equipment... '
b'I tired, but I could not even give it away for FREE!'
b'I cancelled the service in July of 2015, But, Tivo conveniently kept on billing me every month automatically against my checking account..'
b'8 Months later, I am realizing they are still stealing my money after cancellation AND confirmation emails stating it was cancelled.. \xc2\xa0'
b'So, I called them today explaining that they have been fraudently charging my account for 8 months.. \xc2\xa0The "specalist" on the case said, sorry, they can only refund me 90 days... '
b"I'm like, WHAT?? \xc2\xa0You have been stealing money from my bank account systematicaly for 8 MONTHS!!! And you claim I can only get 90 days worth???"
b'This company is beyond corrupt..'
b'After 15 minutes of transferring and talking to more "specialists" and supervisors, eventually the agent, after threathing them with reporting fraud and theft, she goes: "Ok, looks like we forgot to click the cancel button when you called in March.. we\'ll refund your money"'
b'RUN..RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!'

b"Tivo used to have reasonable customer service. \xc2\xa0Now it sucks. \xc2\xa0Called and was told the wait time was approximately 20 minutes. \xc2\xa0After 2 HOURS on hold I gave up. \xc2\xa0Their website was not only NOT helpful with my issue but it provided ABSOLUTELY WRONG information/solution. \xc2\xa0However, the hardware/product remains great . . . Just hope and pray you don't need customer support because you might die of old age before you get it."

b'I have a TIVO device that I rent via my cable company for $20/month (plus $10 for the mini). The system seems to work very well though it has a few things I do not enjoy like having to delete each and every program one at a time twice. Some of the menus take time to learn. '
b'My complaint and low rating is based on the potential purchasing of a TIVO.'
b'I would advise anyone who wants to purchase one to make sure you understand what you are paying for prior to purchase.. '
b'1. The $500 lifetime service agreement only applies to the actual unit you purchase.'
b'If the unit goes into service and it is deemed by them it needs to be replaced the service agreement ends! This means you have to purchase another service agreement for the replacement unit if you want one.'
b'2. Even if you purchase a warranty it does not cover all labor and parts in certain circumstances and you must pay for a replacement. You also have to pay for transportation costs.'
b'After speaking to the TIVO agents I came to the conclusion if TIVO will not fix their equipment at no cost under warranty due to component failures 100% and will not make the service agreement continue to units they replace at no additional fee it is best to not purchase the device and service.'

b"I would give 0 stars if I could. \xc2\xa0I bought a romeo box from tivo that didn't work from day one. \xc2\xa0Was suppose to be new but I think it was refurbished. \xc2\xa0When I called to return box for credit. \xc2\xa0They told me they would not do that. \xc2\xa0Their customer service sucks. \xc2\xa0Better ways to cut the cord than using tivo. \xc2\xa0Table or magna vox new 1tb machine with no monthly fees."

b'Tivo '
b'BOLT'
b'\n'
b'\nReviewed by Ronald Epstein'
b'\nJanuary, 2016'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nWhen Tivo announced the introduction of their '
b'Bolt'
b'Roamio branded DVRs'
b', which set the world on fire in 2013, with their ability to stream recorded content to mobile devices -- anytime -- anywhere.'
b'\n'
b'\nSo, now, two years later, Tivo introduces the '
b'Bolt'
b'. '
b'Should we be excited about an offering that offers new features yet downgrades others?'
b'\n'
b'\nAs usual, I need to start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Tivo DVRs. I have freed myself from the chains of cable company set top boxes for more than a decade now since joining the Tivo family. '
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nWhen Tivo contacted me about reviewing their new '
b'Bolt'
b'Being a highly satisfied owner of their Roamio Plus'
b', and looking over the specs of the '
b'Bolt'
b', I thought I would be downgrading by switching out units. '
b'While the '
b'BOLT'
b'adds 4k and commercial skipping to this new product, it drops the 6 tuners and 3TB storage features of its Roamio predecessor.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'And, while the BOLT costs less to own than the $599 Tivo Roamio Pro, the company has jacked up its Lifetime Service fee by $200'
b", making it more elective, for some, to stick with their cable box. I'll talk about these costs at the close of my review, as I am getting a little bit ahead of myself."
b'\n'
b"\nLet's talk about the "
b'Tivo Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'THE SPECS'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"\nThe biggest surprise for me was the delivery of the Bolt itself. The shipment box was tiny. This couldn't be a Tivo unit...or could it? "
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The Tivo '
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nJust to show you how much smaller and lighter the '
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nTivo Roamio Pro: '
b'16.5" W x 9.7" D x 2.4" H (6.9 lbs.)'
b'\nTivo Bolt: '
b'11.4"W x 7.3"D x 1.8"H '
b'\n'
b'\nThe '
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nSome may find the '
b'Bolt'
b'On the other hand, the Bolt adds support for 4k video and adds some nifty software features including '
b'QuickMode'
b'SkipMode'
b', both which aim to save you time when watching your favorite programming. Additionally, the '
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"\nThe back of the unit shows connections for cable or OTA antenna, optical and audio outputs, Ethernet port (10/100/1000 Mbps), HDMI output, 2 USB inputs and a eSATA connection for additional storage options. You'll also notice a remote finder button that upon being pressed, makes it easy to find your lost controller. Finally, and most notably, the cable card now gets loaded at the bottom of the unit, one of the ingenious ways Tivo was able to keep the "
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'IN USE'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nEverything you need to get started comes in the box, including a quality HDMI cable that is perfect for 4k connection. '
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"\nIf this will be your first Tivo product, you'll find setup to be quite intuitive. After plugging in your cable or antenna to the back of the unit and inserting a multi-stream (M-CARD) cable card underneath, the software walks you through the initial process. Basically, you enter your zip code, Tivo finds your cable provider, and within a few short minutes you are ready to start using your new "
b'Bolt'
b'. You can find a more detailed look at the setup process in my '
b'Tivo Roamio review from 2013'
b'.'
b'\n'
b"\nThose of you who are already Tivo customers will be happy to know that you can transfer over all your existing Season Passes from one device to another by logging onto Tivo's website and selecting TIVO ONLINE -> MANAGE -> ONE PASS MANAGER. Don't expect the transfer of your shows to be flawless. This is the second new Tivo device I have owned where the transfer resulted in duplicate entries. By this, I mean that the new device recorded two versions of my shows both in SD and HD. It also did not properly port over my preferences for just recording new airings vs. all seasons. By the time all was said and done, I found myself manually re-entering every Season Pass myself."
b'\n'
b"\nAnother problem, outside of Tivo's control, is the cable cards themselves. If you are dealing with Verizon, for instance, you'll find yourself on the phone with their support team in an effort to validate the card. Verizon won't let you simply take the card from one device to another, even if it's completely Tivo related. Once the card is inserted in a new device, permissions need to be sent in order to authorize all your subscribed channels. This may not be applicable to every provider, so your situation may vary."
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'USING THE TIVO BOLT'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Under the hood, the'
b'has a faster processor and three times more memory than the Roamio models.'
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nStarting with the Roamio series, Tivo has built-in wireless WiFi which means you no longer need to use their external adapter (which had to be purchased separately). '
b'The Tivo Bolt supports faster network speeds 802.11ac wireless, Gigabit Ethernet, MoCA 2.0'
b'.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Remote Control'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b"\nAt the heart of the Tivo experience is its RF remote control that needs not to be in line-of-site for use. Over the years I have seen these remotes become smaller and more ergonomic friendly. I have always found the remotes very easy to use and appreciate the fact that they can be programmed to any brand of television to control its power, channel and volume features. It might not be able to control your entire home system like an all-in-one remote, but it's perfect for a single display. Speaking of all-in-one remotes, "
b"the Logitech Harmony remotes sync perfectly with Tivo. You won't have any problems using one with this device."
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'SkipMode'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'New and exclusive to the '
b'Bolt'
b', is a feature called SkipMode. It allows you to skip through commercials with the press of a single button on the remote.'
b'\n'
b'\nFirst, the bad news: '
b'SkipMode'
b'\n'
b'\nThe good news is that, when you find a supported show, it works beautifully! '
b'SkipMode'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nAs you come to a commercial in a supported program, an indicator w/sound appears in the upper left corner of your screen, prompting you to press the small, green "D" button on your remote. '
b'When you press the button, the content flawlessly skips the commercials and takes you to the exact resuming point of the content you are watching.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nAs you might suspect, '
b'SkipMode'
b"It's going to take a lot of cooperation between networks and advertisers to allow Tivo to simply skip through commercials."
b'For now, you may find yourself only able to use this feature occasionally.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'(Click on the video above)'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'QuickMode'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Another new feature for the '
b'Bolt'
b', that has also found its way into the Roamio models through a recent update, is '

b'\nThe Tivo Roamio series was a revolutionary product for its ability to stream content to mobile phones and tablets. This has been carried over to the '
b'Bolt'
b', and for me, it still remains the most important aspect of owning a DVR like this. '
b'Essentially, whatever is recorded on your '
b'Tivo Bolt'
b', can be streamed to your portable device via the free Tivo app.'
b'Poor WiFi will only result in constant buffering issues.'
b'\n'
b'\nIncidentally, the iOS app provides support to mirror your Tivo to Apple TV. On Android, you can use Amazon Fire TV for the same purpose.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'I use both the Tivo app and its own website to regularly schedule shows while I am on the road.'
b'All of this can be done remotely'
b', wherever I might be.'
b'\n'
b"\nIn case you don't know exactly what to watch, "
b'Tivo is constantly providing recommendations of the most popular shows.'
b'Tivo also puts together its own Collections based on particular themes or holidays'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'CONCLUSION'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nIf Apple were releasing this product it would most likely be named the Tivo Roamio "S"'
b'\n'
b'\nIn the scheme of things, the '
b'Tivo Bolt'
b'SkipMode'
b'. '
b'\n'
b'\nIt seems to me that the '
b'Tivo Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nIf you already own a Roamio, there really is no need to upgrade right now. In fact, I have been reading that Tivo is planning a newer, more powerful model (possibly this year) for us power users who want the additional tuners and the newer features.'
b'\n'
b'\nHowever, if you own the older models prior to Roamio, or you are looking into buying a Tivo for the first time, the '
b'Bolt'
b'\n'
b'\nStill, '
b'You really are getting the best DVR anywhere when you buy a Tivo.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Likes'
b'\n'
b'\n* Hands down, the best DVR brand you can buy. Tivo continues to raise the bar.'
b'\n* The new, handsome minimalistic design motivates moving this Tivo out of the A/V cabinet and out in the open'
b'\n* Noticeably faster than previous Tivo models'
b'\n* 4k video support, though limited'
b"\n* SkipMode is amazing! Skips commercials without skipping a beat. Let's hope there is more network support for it"
b'\n* QuickMode also works impressively, allowing you to view content 3.5x faster with accurate audio playback'
b'\n* Flawlessly streams content to your favorite portable device no matter where you are'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Dislikes'
b'\n'
b'\n* Still not an economical choice over cable boxes. Tivo needs to continue to bring down monthly fees'
b'\n* Lifetime service ownership increased to $600. That is simply outrageous!'
b'\n* Less storage space and less tuners than Roamio Pro'
b'\n* Limited storage for recorded 4k content, even at 1TB'
b'\n* Does not work with satellite television'

b'\nThanks for great review. '
b'\n'
b"\nThe Bolt is not for me. I just manually upgraded my Roamio to 3TB. I won't buy another 1TB TiVo. and while I've not done the count, I see no value in going backwards to four tuners. There's no flaw or weakness in six tuners, and every mini 'costs' a tuner. It's purely cost savings to TiVo with no benefit or savings to the customer."
b'\n'
b'\n"You can immediately see, from the photo above, that it\'s a rather handsome device"'
b'\nNo. I see an asymmetrically unattractive device that weirds me out. '
b'\n'
b"\nThis is an equivocal upgrade. 4K and faster interface are an improvement. Four tuners, less storage, higher price are significant downgrades from the previous generation. It's like the iPhone 7 getting the new CPU but a camera from two years ago and a $200 price hike. "
b'\n'
b"\nI think for a prospective customer, I'd consider finding a used roamio -- it has the new Quick Mode and is supposedly getting Skip Mode -- or waiting for the Bolt rev 2 or Roamio rev 2.\n"

b"I've rarely read many people happy with switching from TIVO to CableCo equivalents. Part of it is the learning curve learning a new system, but it seems most people end up missing their TIVO and return to it. With some CableCo charging $20 or more a month for a DVR it doesn't help when you are missing your old friend."
b'\n'
b"\nActually the DirecTV DVR I found worked pretty well -- not quite as flexible as TIVO, but much better than most non TIVO DVR I've messed with.\n"

b'\nTwo things I cannot live without on my Tivo....'
b'\n'
b'\nFirst is the QuickMode. I am always pressed for time. Many times, I watch my favorite series in QuickMode. As the video in my review shows, it allows the program to speed up and keep the dialogue distinguishable. So, I can watch an hour program in almost half the time and not miss anything.'
b'\n'
b'\nOf course, the next best feature is SkipMode which allows me to bypass commercials. So far, it works on many CBS and AMC shows I record. Not sure of the other networks.\n'

b"\nWhat's the typical cost to rent a Comcast or Fios DVR? How's that compare to tivo?"
b'\n'
b"\nTiVo has never been the cheapest solution. But they'd been a modest premium over a 3-4 duration compared to renting a cable co box. And if you sold your TiVo used when upgrading, they were even more attractive. "
b'\n'
b"\nBut I don't know how they compare in the age of $80 streaming boxes.\n"

b"If you're going to update the HDD you might as well get the 500GB Tivo for $130-150 off Amazon (or PM at BBY). I bought a cheap used Roamio Plus on Ebay a few months ago and moved my Cable Card from one of my Lifetime TIVOHD (series 3), now I have the TIVOHD set up for dual tuner OTA and Roamio 6tuner for Cable in the same room. If you have several units in service you can often get them to discount the monthly service to $6.95/month. If you want to try Tivo CSR Roulette, you can activate it it for a 6-12 months, then call in to d/c it and see if they offer you a Lifetime deal -- it's been more hit or miss with the current owners. At $70-80 a year the breakeven point for the Lifetime/All-In is 5+ years. "
b'\n'
b"\nTIVO with the Roamio/Bolt removed the ability to do Cable and OTA at the same time. The Roamio and 4 tuner Bolts can be set-up to do one or the other. I'm not sure if there is something technical about the 4 tuners that makes simultaneous usage impossible or that makes 6 tuner units incompatible with OTA."
b'\n'
b"\nThere is the 6 tuner premium 3TB Bolt+ for $499.99 though I've rarely seen much of a deal on them yet or you can stay with the Roamio Pro Line which are going to be cheaper and still offers most of the functionality except 4K."

b"\nIf you have active Series 2 or 3 units there is hope they'll run the upgrade deals again down the line. The recent 199.99 (500GB Bolt) + 99.99 Lifetime transfer was such a screaming deal I had to jump esp with the obsolete Series 2 to use. Drop a $130 4TB Hard Drive in and I'm good to go. At worst, TIVO+Lifetime units still have nice re-sale value if I don't like the Bolt or decide to go other directions.\n"

b"I did a quick Google to check out prices. AT BB you can get a 1TB Bolt for $266. Assume $100 for a 3 TB HD and now it's $366. Add $600 for the lifetime fee and it's now $966. Assume you can get the lifetime service on sale for $300 and it's still $666. Seems pricey."
b'\n'
b'\nHow about OTA? Can it do cable and ota at the same time? DTV eliminated that from their receivers but I got an add on for the receiver that allows it to happen. What does limited 4K mean? How much extra space does 4K use over HD?'
b'\n'
b"\nThe 6 to 4 tuner downgrade still bugs me. It's happened a couple times that I've maxed out my 5 DTV tuners. Maybe this isn't a big deal, but why downgrade, does a tuner cost that much?"
b'Click to expand...'
b'\n'

b"If you're paying $15/mo for a cable co DVR, that's $540 over three years. A $100 premium for the TiVo, to me, is minor. If you can sell the TiVo later for $100+, it's break even. If the TiVo lasts you four years or more, you're actually saving money. "
b'\n'
b"\nAs for the 4-tuner OTA TiVo...I don't know. What I takeaway is that people uninterested in spending money to watch TV are uninterested in spending money to watch TV. So that market is a lower priority, served by the lowest cost option.\n"

b'TiVo Bolt Recorder and Streaming Media Player Review'
b'\n'
b'Excellent storage space compared to many competitors.'
b'In researching for the TiVo BOLT Recorder and Streaming Media Player Review. We found it offered excellent storage space compared to many competitors. Although most people have a minor issue with the $300 and $400 price tags of this recorder, we cannot just undermine the storage space it comes with.'
b'The price is pretty reasonable for the 500GB, 1TB and 3TB memory space the device offers. This means you can watch at least 75 to 300 hours of high definition content on this device. Unlike the'

b'TiVo BOLT recorder'
b'Although this feature has been imitated by other competitors of this DVR, yet the OnePass feature of TiVO happens to be a tad more accurate, effective and reliable than every other DVR and cable model. This is particularly relevant when it comes to recording new episodes of your favorite programs or adjusting when a specific show changes its time slot.'
b'OnePass effectively builds on this by collecting all the episodes of a specific show in an individual folder'
b'OnePass effectively builds on this by collecting all the episodes of a specific show in an individual folder. This is relevant both for live streaming and purchases. Each of these episodes is marked, thereby informing you about whether the recording is that of a repeat telecast or of a streaming-only telecast.'

b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you need a media streaming device if you have a smart TV?Do you need a media streaming device if you have a smart TV? The best way to answer this question is by first asking ourselves what a smart TV is and then go ahead and find out what a streaming media player actually does. For starters, smart TVs, originally called \xe2\x80\x9cConnected TVs\xe2\x80\x9d, are sets\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'

b'"We were bummed when the hard drive on our TiVo went kuput. We looked around for options and for a while settled for a cable box. When we learned that we could replace the hard drive ourselves and keep our lifetime service we were hopeful but apprehensive as we\'re far from being "techies." We ordered a replacement kit from you. It arrived in less than a week with clear and understandable instructions. In short order we had the cover off our unit, the old hard drive out, the new hard drive installed and the cover back in place. With fingers crossed we powered up the unit. Everything worked. We did it! (With your help! \xe2\x98\xba\xef\xb8\x8f\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d). We couldn\'t be happier to be back in TiVoland. If I was more of a techie I would have taken a selfie of us doing the happy dance in our living room in front of our fully operational TiVo. \r\nThank you. We\'re happy and completely satisfied customers. "'

The repair was certainly cheaper than buying another Tivo and had the added benefit of retaining all my existing recordings.

I was expecting half the recording time based on info from your website, but was pleased to see in fact I had doubled the total recording time. (too bad we really don\'t need all that space!)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have the Premeire XL Tivo (with two channels) and it started to act goofy the past few months. The Tivo is around six years old, so no surprise the drive was getting tired. The new drive has been in use for the past couple weeks. Our Tivo works great now and performs perfectly again. Your instructions, Torx tools and drive all worked very well. My family and I are very satisfied.\r\n\r\nThanks for all you and your people do. It certainly allows us to continue enjoying TV the way we have for the past six years - for relatively low cost.\r\n\r\nSincerely"\r\n'

I had bought a TiVo expander drive from Amazon in the past, and hooked it up and my TiVo wouldn\'t recognise it. Fortunately it has eSata and USB connections so can be used as an ordinary external hard drive. This was the only expander drive I could find in NZ, TiVo.co.nz and TiVo.com.au stopped selling them several years back, poor uptake of TiVo around here I think.\r\n\r\nI bought a spare secondhand TiVo so I could upgrade one while keeping the other going. Turns out this was a great idea, now I have the two running together, and I programmed the DVR switch on the remote so it only operates one at a time. This means I can now continue watching the stored programmes remaining on my old drive, and I have the aerial connected to the new TiVo to record any new programmes. This setup is working brilliantly."'

But my time is valuable, and I\'m not inclined to waste it figuring out a technical challenge.  So I ordered from your website on a Friday, paid a fair price, received the replacement drive on Monday (with standard/free shipping) and took 20 whole minutes to install it.  I was back up and running after doing the initial Tivo startup, and everything is working fantastically.

Then I found out the Roamio Plus doesn\'t have support for a digital antenna.  I could buy a Rovio and a DVR Expander, but after reformatting the DVR Expander a third time in less than a month, I just don\'t trust the DVR Expander.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I was in a quandary about what to do.  Then Google gave me a weaKnees option, and I found I could get a Roamio, with the bigger hard drive I wanted, brand new, for about the same cost as a Roamio Plus.

b'"Just a note to verify how easy your kit made replacement of my Tivo drive. I have a series 2 with lifetime service - a few days ago, it began to miss updates. When I called Tivo, they diagnosed the issue as a failure of the device to communicate and download updates. However, I do have a 2nd Tivo, and it did not have the same problem. A quick Google search brought me to Weakness Forum, and there I quickly determined that the issue was a hard drive failure after following instructions to test the drive.\r\n\r\nI ordered a replacement and followed the included (very clear!) instructions. In 15 minutes, the Tivo was back online. After the program updates, the unit works flawlessly. And a great side benefit, the Tivo system information now shows that I can store up to 395 hours rather than the 40 hours maxiumum before the Weakness replacement.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this simple fix preserved my lifetime service and increased my recording capacity by nearly 10X. The pictures imbedded in the instructions were very clear and easy to follow - and included all the tools needed for the replacement. No need to hack the Tivo to format and replace a broken drive - it came ready-to-go out of the box. Great way to improve my investment!"'

b"That was just freaking awesome!!! I thought my Tivo 2/Toshiba hard drive died a few years ago when I ordered my new hard drive. For whatever reason, it pulled through by the time the hard drive arrived and I never bothered to replace it. Well, it acted up again - this time, it wouldn't pull through. Popped open the box and found super exact instructions along with tools. I needed nothing else to install this hard drive. I powered the unit back up, went through setup and it is back up and running with almost 3X the amount of space as the old drive. How awesome is THAT! \r\n\r\nGood job! Nay! FANTASTIC JOB!!! \r\n\r\nI hope I'm not a repeat customer, but won't hesitate when the time comes again.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

I had just finally gotten around to pulling it from the cabinet under the TV and was all set to throw it away as I was under the assumption it couldn\'t be repaired and keep the lifetime plan it came with intact but thankfully before I did I gave it a google and wound up on the WeaKnees website. Fast forward a few days, I\'m sitting here in amazement at how easy it was to get it going again good as new. The upgrade kit included the HDD, all tools needed & idiot-proof step-by-step instructions w/ pictures. It took less than 15 minutes before I had it hooked back up to the TV & was navigating TiVO\'s guided setup once again just like when it was new just out of the box. Sweeeeeeeet!

Googled "TiVo problems" and the 3rd listing was your "TiVo Repair and Troubleshooting Guide". Since it looked like my hard drive was a goner, I was thrilled to see I could replace it and keep the lifetime service we paid $249 for years ago. Got it within days and, since my husband was taking too long getting it installed, I decided to do it. Took me about an hour, which most of the time I spent unscrewing the lid...with the small side of the tool...but when I discovered I could use the other end, it went much faster! :-) The directions (which I was afraid hubby wouldn\'t even look at!) were absolutely spot on! Had it up and running first time...and I\'m a girl!! Can\'t thank you enough for tripling my storage space and making it so easy to do at a great price! Have already bragged on you on Facebook!

Turns out after I opened up the TiVo, I figured out that there was no power to the hard drive, fan or lights so why not just buy a whole new power supply board.\r\n\r\nI Googled a couple of things and found WeaKnees...within 5 minutes I found the exact part I needed from your website...incredibly easy and $50 cheaper than the TiVo refurb option. Got the part in 2 business days and within 10 minutes I replaced the power board, closed it up and plugged it back in and voila! My TiVo was alive again!

Once things had warmed up, though, the whole hardware process took less than 10 minutes, with no fuss or ambiguity -- great instructions and all the gear fit perfectly. Then I reconnected the dvr and its wireless adapter and it immediately fired up perfectly and shook hands with Tivo Central and we were back in business. Replacing the drive was exactly the answer to the mysterious, frustrating problems we\'d been having.

I\'d resigned myself to buying an 80 hour box when I discovered that I could get a replacement modem from your website. I was actually skeptical of your claim that the new modem would "install in minutes" (nothing is ever THAT easy) or that it would even solve our problem, but the price was much better than a downgraded box and far preferable to giving up our 180 hour box and having to reprogram all our season passes, etc. So I bought the modem and was thrilled to discover that it really did solve the problem, and that it really did install in less than 5 minutes!

After a quick look over the instructions, I was quickly at\r\nwork replacing the components and it seemed I was finished in almost\r\nno time. After connecting all the cables and powering the unit back\r\nup, the set-up went without a hitch and I was back in business. I couldn\'t believe how quietly the unit operated after living with a noisy fan and hard drive for so long. Bet it took only 10 or 15 minutes from start to finish....Thanks for helping put new life in my Tivo receiver.:'

b'"Hello, I just could not let this experience go un told. First I google to find a place where I can have my Tivo serviced. Next..I find Weakness.com..a masterful website. Most websites will try to take your money first before either giving you alternatives or other options to resolve your problem. not Weakness.com. This site was remarkable. Not only was the site easy to navigate, but it was also very informative. I was able to narrow down my search to resolve my specific issue and as a result I ordered a power supply pack.\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions on how to remove my power supply in my Tivo and it was a simple as ABC. I believe a cave man could have followed those instructions they were so simple. Usually very technical issues you find that the people who are specialized in it find it difficult to simplify instructions for the average Jane and Joe, not Weakness.com the website and those that are responsible for it are masters of their trade.\r\n\r\nI am not savy with electronics but I walked away from this experience actually feeling like I learned something. I also emailed prior to my purchace and the response time was similar to a micro minute (lol) im kidding but it was so fast I almost thought it was an automated response until I emailed again and the email had more specific details to my question that only a human could have composed. I called the customer service sales department and spoke with a gentlemen (sorry I didnt get his name) who processed my order and he too was very polite, professional, efficient and knowlegeable as I asked him a few questions and he anwered them as he could without having the device in front of him. I want to thank him as well for adding to my wonderful experience. I hope there is a place where I can add my experience to a feedback or blog area. People should know about your website and I am sure they will have the same if not better (if thats possible-lol) experience.\r\n\r\nI will be sure to email back the results of the purchased power supply pack.\r\n\r\nYour company has a terrific team of web designers, instruction writers, and customer service (phone and email) representatives. Keep up the great work. I will definitly spread the word.\r\n\r\nP.S. The multiple pay options is also fantastic.\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\nHave a safe and pleasant holiday."'

The installation instructions were clear and easy to follow and in no time at all, my Tivo was booted up and running perfectly again. Thanks for your great service for all us Tivo fans! \r\n"'

b'"When my TIVO-based DirecTv unit recently began to re-start at random, I knew I was in trouble. I suspected the hard drive was failing. Sure enough, the system soon reached a point where it would not re-start at all. I contacted DirecTv but all they would offer was to "lease" me a non-TIVO box. Since I seemed to have no other option, I tried the DirecTv system. However, it took only a few days of using their system to realize just how inferior it was in comparison to TIVO. It was like swapping your new Lexus for a Kia Rio! The thought that I had lost my TIVO was depressing and having to pay a monthly fee to lease the DirecTv system only added to my torment. I searched the internet in the hopes of finding another alternative. That was when I found the Weaknees web site. I ordered a hard drive replacement kit. When it arrived, it took less than 1/2 hour to install it and that includes giving the insides of my old system a complete cleaning with compressed air to remove the dust build-up. The instructions are simple. If you can read english and turn a screw, then you can install one of these kits. With the new hard drive installed, my old system roared back to life. It is even better than before since my new hard drive is 4 times larger than the old one that failed. I have already made arrangements to ship the non-TIVO box back to DirecTv. I want to thank Weaknees for their highly useful products. It is good to know that TIVO owners have a resource to fall back on if their equipment fails and are not left to the tender mercies of the cable and satellite companies."'

In no time I had a UPS tracking number emailed to me, and I could follow it to my door. Which I did, and it got here as specified by UPS........\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the new drive kit, the hardest part of the job was unhooking the TiVo from the entertainment center and pull it out to do the installation.\r\n\r\nOnce I opened up the TiVo and took out the old drive, installation of the 2 new drives and new fan took just a few minutes to make the job complete. The instructions were easy to understand, but the job is so easy I barely even looked at them. (Just to make sure where the "A" and "B" drives belonged)\r\n\r\nAbout a half hour and the rig was hooked back up and downloading from the DirecTv satelites.\r\n\r\nWe now have a variable 259 hours capacity, up from the almost 40 we limped along with before\r\nlearning about weaKnees..........\r\n\r\nI can honestly say that no one should be afraid to tackle this upgrade, as it really is such a\r\n"no brainer" that anyone with the ability to turn a screwdriver ahould be able to master this really easy upgrade.\r\n\r\nAlso, this upgrade made a nice "extra" Holiday gift for my bride of 40 years. We now look at each other around this time of the year and ask what to buy a person who has all the toys they need. The same old question: What do you want for Christmas this year dear ? ? And all you get is shrug of the sholders and a blank deer in the headlights stare - - And an "I don\'t know" for an answer.........\r\n\r\nA TiVo upgrade is a heck of a lot better than a pair of slippers that don\'t fit or jewelery that always goes back.........This time around, she really loves the added capacity that this new TiVo upgrade has provided our machine. This year I\'m her HEEERO ! ! ! !\r\n\r\nPlus, during racing season we will now be able to record NASCAR races, F-1, Indy Car & CART and still have room for her soaps and other shows we want to save for later viewing, then we can blow through them almost commercial free - - What a deal ! ! ! !\r\n\r\nweaKnees, thanks for a super product line and super service - I am glad I found you on the net............Have a very Merry Christmas.\r\n\r\nKind regards"'

b'" I recently had a hard drive die on my Toshiba DVR/DVD burner combo. It was the second such event in three years, and I was not looking forward to having to pack up and ship the thing back to Toshiba. I surfed to your site, ordered a replacement drive, installed it myself and was Tivo-ing again in just a couple of days. The installation couldn\'t have been easier (did I mention that I\'m not tech savvy), and the documentation was superb!\r\n\r\nYou guys are great!

Your installation instructions were easy to follow and the whoe hard drive change took 5 minutes. I couldn\'t be happier that i don\'t have to use the POS DirecTV Plus DVR that I got.

Before I opened the\r\npackage, I started rummaging through my tool box looking for some\r\ntorx bits. Couldn\'t find any, so I thought I would take one of the\r\nscrews out of your package to the hardware store to match up to a\r\ntorx bit I would need to purchase. Of course I was thrilled to see\r\nyou had included two torx allen wrenches in your package when I\r\nopened it up. In addition, you included a note for installation\r\ninstructions that could be found on the website.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to say thanks for the extra touches that made the\r\nreplacement of the fan quick and easy!"'

The directions were super easy to follow and including the tools was a great touch.  Literally got my Tivo "repaired" in about 7 minutes.  Ordered on Thursday and repair kit arrived Friday..just in time for all the races!\r\n\r\nI just so happy that we diddn\'t have to switch to the "DirecTV brand DVR becuase in our eyes its no match against Tivo.\r\n\r\nThanks again"'

b'"The first time I used WeaKnees I had them upgrade my Sony series 2 because I was hesitant about doing it myself. The unit was only a few weeks old and I figured it was safer to have them do it. About 4 years later the picture began to freeze up intermittently and I decided to replace the hard drive. When I asked WeaKnees about shipping the unit back to them, they explained how easy it was to change the drive myself and it would save me money and time. Now that I wasn\'t dealing with a brand new unit I figured I would take a chance and do it myself. I couldn\'t believe how easy their step by step instructions were. I fixed it myself and it up was up and running in about a half hour.\r\n\r\nIn October I ordered a Series 3 with the 750GB hard drive from them. Like other people, mine had the noisy hard drive problem. I called WeaKnees and they e-mailed me a free UPS shipping label. My unit was repaired and shipped out the same day that they received it. By the way, I left both cable cards in the unit when I shipped it back to them (NYC to LA). Today it arrived and when I plugged it in I didn\'t hear a sound. Within 10 minutes it automatically connected to Tivo for updated program information and I am now enjoying a very quiet HD Tivo.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend WeaKnees as I have found them to be very reliable and honest. \r\n"'

b'"I just wanted to add my kudos to Weaknees.com \'s long list of happy customers.\r\nI had purchased my Series 1, 40 hour Tivo -and the lifetime service - about 5 years ago.  After enjoying my favorite shows on my own schedule for so long, I was devastated to find that my Tivo was not working one night.  After some internet research, I found Weaknees.com\r\n(love the name!) and read all the troubleshooting information.  It sounded to me that my hard drive had "failed".  So I called to ask some questions and ended up purchasing an upgrade replacement hard drive from Jason.  He assured me that we would be able to replace the hard drive with very little trouble.  My husband was confident (I was less sure because todays electronics also seem so complicated).  Our hard drive arrived in just 2 days, and it took my husband only about 20 minutes from start to finish to remove the back cover, take out the defective hard drive, install the new drive, and re-attach the back cover (the hardest part was getting the cover back on straight).  I wanted to perserve my lifetime service and Jason at Weaknees.com assured me it would be fine as long as we didn\'t touch the motherboard.  \r\n\r\nI had a slight problem with the set-up but it was totally due to my error and skipping over the screen to select "no cable box" on the set-up screen.  It was Saturday-Jason had told me that although they are no available by phone on Saturdays at Weaknees.com they do monitor their email and respond.  Once someone at Weaknees.com pointed out my little problem (within 5 minutes of my sending the email question) I back tracked on the setup and soon my TIVO was busy downloading all program information.  I now have my TIVO back - better than new since I now can record 165 hours at basic quality - instead of the original 40 hours - AND best of all: my lifetime service is still in effect!!!  WOW.  WEAKNEES.com is the best.  (And we feel like real techies-which we are most certainly not!)\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU - if I had stopped my research at the TIVO website, I would have ened up spending about $500.00 more for a new TIVO and would not have TIVO service for longer than 3 years.\r\n\r\nI will be happy to let everyone know about your company. If anyone is nervous about doing the replacement hard drive themselves I can assure them it is not difficult - just follow the uncomplicated instructions that are included with the hard drive (and Weaknees.com also sends all the tools needed). EXCELLENT! Thanks again.  Tonight, after work I can watch Oprah and Dr. Phil again."'

I ordered this on the past weekend, and chose the "free" delivery option. I received my drive this Wednesday!!! The instruction were "spot-on"\r\nand it was so so easy to do. Hell, it took me longer to uncable/unplug my Tivo then it did to swap out the drive!!! I re-installed my Tivo, powered it up - and it came right up as all the necessary software was pre-installed on the drive. Then "Tivo" walked me thought re-initializing of the system (took about 1/2 hour) and everything worked perfect the very first time!!!

I contacted the local TV/Appliance repair outfit and they were reluctant to try to repair it, indicating that parts were almost impossible to obtain.  They offered to look at it, re-solder joints, etc.  Since I had spent $350 on the unit a year prior, I looked further and found your site.  The (VERY HELPFUL) information on your site about symptoms matched what I was experiencing and indicated the need for a hard-drive replacement.   I ordered a hard drive, got it via FEDEX within the week,  found the installation instructions very helpful and complete, and restored my TIVO to working order with a single call to TIVO to restore local channels.  The TIVO unit responds even faster than before to commands.  I\'m very satisfied with the service!"'

The completed upgrade from turn-off to turn-on took 1 hour including time to clean out the 2 years of accumulated dust.  The rubber grommets on the new fans were a nice touch and the noise level remained very low like the original.

I immediately replaced the hard drive, which took no more than 5 minutes to complete.  I think that you guys must\'ve known that, if you didn\'t include the allen wrenches, many of us would\'ve put the task off until later.  A stroke of marketing genius; and it works.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I am ecstatic about doing business with Weaknees.

It took me about 20 minutes to read through the easy to follow and clear instructions (which, I agree, are pretty important to review, even if you have a good deal of PC-upgrade experience) and about 30-minutes to perform the actual upgrade. No harder than adding a hard drive to a desktop PC, but there\'s a bit of finesse to it (as explained in the instructions).\r\n \r\nI like the way you guy have designed an ABS bracket to accommodate the second drive and extra cooling fan. Everything fit tight and snug. Nice job!\r\n \r\nI\'d recommend using www.weaknees.com to my friends who own TiVo systems."'

I would rate my level of experience as high - I\'ve assembled my own PCs before, so installing IDE drives is no biggie.  I think anyone could do this though - it\'s easier than assembling a piece of Ikea\r\nfurniture.  The photos with parts labelled were very useful.  The items I got in the kit matched exactly what was shown in the instructions. Excellent service from your company...!"'

b'"I just wanted to take a moment to write you about an upgrade package I ordered from you. I easily found all the information about upgrading my DVR on your site as your site is extremely "user friendly." I had an existing 40 GB HD which provided about 35 hours of recording. Problem was, I couldn\'t even record my favorite football\'s team NFL season with that capacity. In the past, I have upgraded my PC including memory, video and hard drive modifications but I was still a little leary about opening up my TIVO DVR. With your site\'s guidance, I decided to go with installing an additional HD as opposed to replacing the original. I purchased the 120 GB HD upgrade providing an additional 105 hours. I received the upgrade on a Wednesday and reserved my Saturday morning for installing it, figuring it would be a real chore. That Saturday, I began the install at 9:30 AM. Your instructions are incredible. Easy to understand and fully illustrated. To my shock, by 9:45 I was plugging my upgraded (now approximately 150 hour capacity) DVR back into the wall. I powered it up and ran the system check and bingo, I was good to go. Thank you WeaKnees for a truly great product and a truly wonderful web-site.\r\n\r\nThanks again from a now loyal customer"'

I just received my new hard drive that I ordered from you for my Sony SVR 3000 and the installation was extremely easy once again.

The only problem was the 14 Hr limit for saving shows. We ordered the 120 gig replace drive from you which would increase our recording time to 114 hrs. The hard drive was received very quickly and took only about 20 minutes to do the replacement. Everything went smoothly with the easy to follow instructions. Everything also worked perfectly fine after restarting the TIVO. We are very pleased with the results, the service, and the advice. Thank you so much for your help and dedication to your business.

The unit works great and even seems to be marginally quieter than the previous stock HDVR2 which I returned to Best Buy.... I was surprised that the quality of the recordings appears to be as good as the direct feed I got through my previous RCA DirecTV standard receiver. I added a multiswitch and retained the RCA for direct viewing and notice that switching between the Tivo and the RCA feeds really don\'t show that one is noticeably superior to the other. I have a pretty good 32 inch Sony XBR squared (the one that some of the reviewers used to say gave the best picture they had ever seen on ANY television) and I don\'t really see a real difference. I was prepared for a certain amount of picture degradation (but better than the Super VHS recorders I usually use for time shifting). Anyway, I am very happy."'

I am a 54 year old woman who is not prone to taking stuff apart or putting it back together. My Tivo\'s harddrive started to sputter in the last month or two after years of dedicated (and a whole lot of) use. So I researched solutions. Everything pointed to you. But, could I do it? Your website gave me courage and I ordered. Your delivery time was excellent and the free shipping was sweet. Thank you. I planned my upgrade carefully as I had to watch everything on the harddrive first. Not easy. But, I did it. The hardest part, as you can imagine, was getting the cover off. I nearly gave up several times. Then those little screw drivers you sent are cute but those screws were in there tight and where are the nice big rubber handles to grip with? Not to worry, I managed. In fact, including the dusting out with canned air, the whole thing from unhooking to rehooking took 20 minutes. Total, tops and I spent a lot of that time reading the directions. I plugged it in and turned on the TV and voila! We currently importing even as I type. Thanks so much for a great product and great service. I now not only have a brand new bigger harddrive but the satisfaction of knowing I did it myself. Kinda. Thanks,"'

Of course, there are costs and other considerations, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve focused on what makes a DVR worth your time.'

b'\n'
b'We love skipping commercials on the top 20 channels with SkipMode. Other DVRs may have fast-forwarding, but you end up missing the beginning of the scene, rewinding, then fast-forwarding\xe2\x80\xa6it gets tedious. SkipMode skips that part of TV.'

b'If you want Over The Air signals (which we cover below), the Bolt+ won\xe2\x80\x99t work. The standard version, '
b'TiVo Bolt'
b', does, but it comes with 1 TB less storage and two less tuners. TiVo Minis are a bit expensive at $100 per unit, so connecting your whole home could be pricey.'

b'With the'
b', you can expect average DVR service costs of $15 per month, or you can opt for a longer contract (either year or lifetime) that will save you money. A year costs $150 total, saving you $30 overall. Or if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to commit to a \xe2\x80\x9clifetime plan,\xe2\x80\x9d you can pay $550 once up front, which hits our cost-effective mark at about three years.'

b'It has by far the most storage as well as the most useful features from a provider DVR. Hopper has 2,000 SD hours, which is a ridiculous amount\xe2\x80\x94 perfect for binge-watching shows like '
b'Seinfeld'

b'How I Met Your Mother'

b'\n'
b'What really makes the '
b'Hopper'
b'\xc2\xa0jump(!) out is its special features: AutoHop, voice control, and remote finder. AutoHop skips commercials with a single button, no guesswork needed. The voice control remote means you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to select and type individual letters into your search, while the remote finder is a lifesaver for anyone who has spent more time looking for the remote than watching their show.'

b'\n'
b'We like to pause the game to grab snacks or use the bathroom, but DVRs are also great when life interrupts your flow, and you need to help someone in with the groceries or drop the kids off at practice. Plus, if you\xe2\x80\x99re coming home late from work or just want to avoid ads, you can start recording, give yourself 5\xe2\x80\x9310 minutes of prep-time, hit play, and watch the game \xe2\x80\x9clive\xe2\x80\x9d with all the conveniences of playback control, despite being offset from the rest of the world just by a bit.'

b'Recording is pretty universal across DVRs: either choose a single episode or select an entire series to record. This means you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to set up your DVR every single week to keep up with '
b'The Walking Dead'
b'The Voice'
b'\xe2\x80\x94just once. Some DVRs even automatically record recommendations based on your viewing. '
b'DISH Hopper 3'
b'\n'
b'For more information, see the FAQ below.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Number of recordings'
b'\n'
b'Make sure the number of recording and watching streams covers your needs because if you have five people in your house and only four streams, someone is going to have to compromise. With the '
b'DISH Hopper 3'
b', you can get up to 16 recordings going at once (which is ridiculous). When you use additional units like the Joey, Genie Mini, or TiVo Mini, you\xe2\x80\x99re increasing the number of individual streams to TVs, but rarely (if ever) do these devices add storage.'

b'\n'
b'Playback controls'
b'\n'
b'While pausing and rewinding are standard, fast-forwarding is a little less common because of licensing agreements. Companies make money from ad revenue, and advertisers pay only if they see results. Thus, TV service providers agree to disable certain content from fast-forwarding.'
b'\n'
b'That being said, we absolutely love when fast-forwarding is available. Better yet, we love when we can skip immediately to the end of a commercial. TiVo has SkipMode and DISH has AutoHop, both of which automatically go to the end of a commercial and remove the guesswork on your end, preventing possible spoilers\xe2\x80\x94or at least some frustration.'

b'Get service to each TV'
b'\n'
b'Basically, we want to make sure you get DVR service for every TV in your home. This ability has no standard industry term, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it whole-home connectivity.'
b'\n'
b'According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average number of TVs per household is 2.3 TVs per house.'
b'2'
b'Hopper 3'
b'Tablo 2'
b'\n'
b'Each company has its own way of providing whole-home connectivity, so unless this is your main concern, we recommend picking your DVR based on storage and other features.'

b'Watch anywhere/mobile/on the go'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'While the number of TV sets per household is declining, actual programming viewership is up. More people are just watching television on their mobile devices like phones and tablets. Experts estimate most households use an average of seven connected devices every day.'
b'3'
b'\n'
b'Over 55% of people consider mobile DVR service to be very important.'
b'4'
b'5'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Personally, we often use our tablets and phones to stream content from '
b'XFINITY'
b', Netflix, and YouTube Red. To give you an idea, we\xe2\x80\x99ve included a screenshot from XFINITY\xe2\x80\x99s mobile on-demand interface.'
b'\n'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to use, has all the info you need, and allows you to turn on closed captions and Spanish overdubbing easily. You can also \xe2\x80\x9cpush\xe2\x80\x9d the video to your big screen when you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of holding up your phone or when the whole gang needs to watch.'
b'\n'
b'Whether you use your mobile device as a (voice) remote, schedule recordings while away from home, or just like having mobile and offline access, this is one of the best parts of modern TV.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'What is OTA TV programming?'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'OTA is short for Over the Air. In many locations, you can receive free (HD) programming\xe2\x80\x94all you need is an antenna. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to save money and still keep up on the big networks, as well as a few movie channels and family favorites like PBS.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'With three broadcast towers within 50 miles, we could get an antenna with that mileage range for under $30 bucks. You can check out the '
b'1byone 50 Mile Range Amplified HDTV Antenna'
b', or if you need a greater range, the '
b'ViewTV Outdoor Amplified Antenna'
b'\n'
b'While Over the Air isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect for everybody, fans of network TV and sports can find a lot to watch. The following DVRs on our list are OTA compatible: '
b'DISH Hopper 3'
b', '
b'DIRECTV Genie'
b', and '
b'Tablo 2'
b'. Strangely, '

b'Costs'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Those planning on using a DVR for more than three years should consider purchasing it up front. Renting is a better option for up-to-date technology, replacement equipment, and non-committed users.'
b'\n'
b'With third parties, part of the cost consideration is whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick with the same TV provider for a few years. While you may potentially have access to a better-brand DVR if you switch services, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice knowing you have a reliable DVR no matter which provider you end up with\xe2\x80\x94a big reason why we picked '
b'TiVo Bolt+'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'What makes a DVR cost-effective?'
b'\n'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed the industry average cost per month is around $15 bucks, so\xe2\x80\x94'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'1 year = $180'
b'\n'
b'2 years = $360'
b'\n'
b'3 years = $540'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'So if you can choose a DVR for three years for under $540, you\xe2\x80\x99re saving more than the average DVR user. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into consideration costs like repairs, maintenance, or upgrades, and it is also possible for subscription rates and fees to increase.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'The cost of going wireless'
b'\n'
b'Going wireless with your additional units can keep your place looking tidy and minimal. We\xe2\x80\x99d opt for this to prevent drilling holes and running cables through walls.'
b'\n'
b'Installation costs vary with wireless units. '

b'DVRs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just the VCRs of the future'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'Some people might not want to fuss with a DVR, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know the power it holds. You can become the curator of a vast library of TV, control time with a remote (or even your voice), and instantly pull-up sport stats with a single button. Keep in mind, you can do all this on your couch. Future\xe2\x80\x99s here, folks\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get a DVR.'

b'\n'
b'What is a Cloud DVR?'
b'\n'
b'A Cloud DVR\xe2\x80\x99s storage is based on a company\xe2\x80\x99s server, but it is accessible by users just about everywhere. Think of it as \xe2\x80\x9coff-site\xe2\x80\x9d storage for your DVR, which means you can switch devices and keep your library.'
b'\n'
b'Can I expand my storage with a hard drive?'
b'\n'
b'Most DVRs can expand their storage. Make sure it has a SATA port if you\xe2\x80\x99re planning on adding an external hard drive.'

b'TiVo Launches Bolt Vox And Mini Vox DVRs With Voice Control And 4K Playback'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'

b'\n'
b'\n'

b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\nThere has been an explosion of '
b'set-top boxes'
b', streaming sticks, and media casting dongles over the past few years. To keep up with the times (and an ever growing field of competitors), '
b'TiVo'
b'\n'
b"\nThe TiVo Bolt Vox comes with the new remote control. It is the flagship DVR in TiVo's lineup and combines the company's most powerful DVR with the popular online streaming services. Both it and the TiVo Vox Mini are largely unchanged from their "
b', except for a color change (black instead of white) and native voice support, a feature that TiVo is pushing hard as part of a unified experience.'
b'\n'
b'\n"With our new on-screen experience and Vox Remote, scrolling through endless TV guides and painstakingly entering search terms is finally a thing of the past," said Malone. "Bolt Vox is the only platform that combines the complete pay TV experience with major OTT services into a single user experience, on one input, controlled by one remote, with unified voice search across multiple sources."'
b'\n'
b'\nThere are three storage options for the Bolt Vox, starting with the 500GB model ($200) that can record and store up to 75 hours of HD footage. Next up from that is a 1TB model ($300), which doubles the recording capacity to up to 150 hours of HD footage. Both it and the 500GB model feature four tuners for recording up to four shows simultaneously.'
b'\n'
b'\nThe beefiest model checks in at 3TB ($500), which is enough storage to record up to 450 hours of HD content. This one also ups the ante with two additional TV tuners so users can record up to six shows at the same time.'
b'\n'
b"\nLikewise, TiVo's Mini Vox ($180) is an upgraded version of the non-Vox Mini. It is smaller than the Bolt Vox and extends the functionality of the primary set-top DVR to other TVs in the household. And like the Bolt Vox, it supports "
b'4K'
b'Existing TiVo Bolt, TiVo Roamio, and first generation TiVo mini customers can purchase the new remote by itself for $40. Unlike the upgraded boxes, it is available in both white and black color options.'
b'All of the new products will be available on October 29 from TiVo and Amazon, the latter of which is '
b'accepting pre-orders'

b'\n'
b'TiVo is certainly facing competition these days, with set-top boxes, TVs and consoles all offering a variety of smart and/or '
b'DVR'
b'called Bolt'
b', introduces a couple new features that show TiVo still has gas in the tank, even with new Apple TVs and other inventions on the horizon.'
b'\n'
b'The TiVo Bolt is\xe2\x80\xa6odd-looking. It has a strange, warped appearance that may have looked cool in concept but gives it a half-baked appearance as a final product. But once set up, the fun begis: This set top box can handle a lot of basic DVRing features, but its big news is a couple new abilities.'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'\n'
b'First, Bolt uses SkipMode to automatically and smartly skip commercials seamlessly, a feature that consumers have wanted pretty much before the TiVo even existed. Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new QuickMode feature that speeds things up by around 30%, but keeps voices smooth and low so you can listen without being irritated by the chipmunks. TiVo hints that this will be handy when catching up on DVRed sports games.'
b'\n'
b'Tivo Bolt 4K DVR Inputs'
b'\n'
b'Other, more ordinary features include notable 4K support for the latest resolutions, OneSearch to search for shows immediately across all apps and channels, access to web apps and variety of smart streaming services, and up to 4 simultaneous recordings at once. There\xe2\x80\x99s a choice between 500 and 1,000GB TiVo Bolts.'
b'\n'
b'The new features are welcome, but it comes back to what we have said about TiVos before. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t already have one, there are plenty devices that can take their place, including an '
b'Xbox One'
b', an Apple TV, A Roku, and other various consoles, '
b'smart TVs'
b', and cable boxes. But if saving a lot of shows at once is important, of it you already have a TiVo, then the Bolt may be a must-buy. Those new features add more value to DVRing than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in quite a while.'
b'\n'
b'Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s also the price. The Bolt costs around $300, pretty high for a cable box, although that does include a year of TiVo service. The 1,000GB version costs $400 if you want the upgrade.'

b'In the beginning, the TiVo set-top box was just a digital video recorder. You\xe2\x80\x99d look over a list of upcoming TV shows and movies on the channels you get, and click Record for each one you want to capture. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what time or channel they\xe2\x80\x99ll be on.\xc2\xa0'
b'Then, on playback, you\xe2\x80\x99d skip 30 seconds at a time, fast-forward, and so on, using the world\xe2\x80\x99s best-designed remote. Virtually overnight, TiVo made old-school VCRs obsolete.'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a new TiVo model now, called the Bolt. It still does all of that. But you\xe2\x80\x99re probably thinking what everyone\xe2\x80\x99s thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cNobody watches TV anymore! Everything\xe2\x80\x99s available online; who needs a TV box?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ah, but TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s been thinking that, too. So the Bolt is conceived as a clever hub for the whole '
b'universe '
b'of video. It searches and browses '
b'both '
b'Web services '
b'and '
b'what\xe2\x80\x99s on TV, treating them identically.'
b'Right now, the Bolt can search and play back shows from Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, Comcast or Cox on demand (if you have it), and, of course, whatever TV channels you get. It can also play music from Spotify, Pandora, Plex, and IHeartRadio. There are apps for YouTube, AOL On, Yahoo Screen, and others.'
b'Hulu is coming soon, says TiVo, and it\xe2\x80\x99s working to get the on-demand services of other cable companies. Don\xe2\x80\x99t count in seeing the online movie stores from Apple or Google showing up, though.'
b'Story Continues'
b'The point is, if you search for a certain movie, the Bolt shows you everywhere you can get it. Similarly, if you select a series, the Bolt assembles a playlist of all episodes, all seasons, ready to play, regardless of which services they come from.'
b'It can list, record, and play back 4K (ultra HD) shows, too, like the ones available from Netflix and Amazon.'
b'Plenty of boxes attempt to consolidate all '
b'online '
b'movie services: Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, Chromecast. But the TiVo Bolt also incorporates '
b'actual '
b'TV, the kind most Americans are still paying a cable service to receive.'
b'Partway Folded'
b'The least likeable thing about the TiVo Bolt, if you ask me, is its design. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tiny white plastic rectangle\xe2\x80\x94that part\xe2\x80\x99s fine\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s '
b'bent in the middle. '
b'TiVo says that that design is partly for ventilation, but mostly to look striking. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s striking, all right\xe2\x80\x94but it means that you can\xe2\x80\x99t put any other components on top of it. Or you can, but they\xe2\x80\x99re tilted, which could mean vague psychological distress every time you sit down on your couch and see it.'
b'As with other TiVos, this one requires that you replace your cable box with a CableCard. It looks like a metal credit card and goes into a slot in a compartment under the TiVo. You have to request one from your cable company, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a nice payoff: You get rid of a remote control, you eliminate a box and its associated cords, and you may save a couple bucks a month in box rental.'
b'Speed and speed'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re not bent out of shape by the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s being bent out of shape, the next pill to swallow is the TiVo Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s price: $300 for the box with a 500-GB hard drive, or $400 for a 1-terabyte drive. Plus, starting in the second year, you have to pay a monthly $15 fee. (You can also pay $150 a year\xe2\x80\x94a $30 annual savings. Or you can pay a one-time $600 and be done with it.)'
b'You do get a lot for that money, however. This is a premium box for premium couch potatoes.'
b'For one thing, this puppy is '
b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t heave and sigh and think every time you press a button on the remote. Apps like Netflix open in the time it takes you to pour a can of soda, not the time it takes to make popcorn.'
b'All the guts are better than on the last model, the Roamio: 3 times the memory, gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac WiFi, the ability to stream video to other TiVos in the house using its built-in wiring, and so on.'
b'The on-screen design is improved and streamlined, too. The remote uses RF (radio frequency) waves instead of infrared, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need be line of sight with the box. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the remote, a button on the Bolt itself makes the remote play a little tune so you can find it.'
b'You can now play back shows at 1.3 times their actual speed, too, without affecting the pitch of the audio. (You hit the Play and then Select buttons on the remote to turn this Quick Mode on or off.)\xc2\xa0'
b'1.3X is a good choice. It gets you through a 60-minute show in 46 minutes without turning the TV characters into chipmunks. The musical tempos are a little faster, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain overcaffeinated quality to people who already talk fast. But for sports, awards shows, and Kubrick movies, it\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic.'
b'A semi-automatic weapon against ads'
b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the Big Ticket Item: You get the ability to skip entire blocks of ads with a single button press.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a spectacular feature. You\xe2\x80\x99re watching a show; the first ad comes on; you press the D button; and '
b'boom\xe2\x80\x94'
b'you\xe2\x80\x99re back into the show, at the exact spot where it fades in after the last of the six commercials. (If you '
b'want '
b'to see the ads, the channel up/down buttons jump to the beginning or end of each ad block.)'
b'TiVo is wading into dangerous, network-baiting waters. Ad-skipping technology is part of what killed off TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s onetime rival, ReplayTV. And this TiVo feature sounds almost identical to the Autohop feature of Dish satellite boxes, which quickly ran into legal challenges from ABC/Disney, CBS, NBC, and Fox.'
b'Both ad-skipping services (Dish and TiVo) are available only for national, primetime shows. In TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s case, the ad-skipping works only on shows recorded from 4pm to midnight, on the 20 top channels. In your list of recordings, a SKIP logo appears on the names of shows for which ad-skipping is available.'
b'So why not all shows, all the time? Because\xe2\x80\x94get this\xe2\x80\x94like Dish, TiVo has employees who watch these shows and '
b'manually tag '
b'you. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the ad-skipping feature isn\xe2\x80\x99t available until shortly after a show has been broadcast; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t in place yet if, for example, you\xe2\x80\x99re watching the beginning of a show while the end is still recording.'
b'Dish semi-lost its legal battle with CBS, agreeing to make ad-skipping available only a '
b'week '
b'after the show\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast; for ABC/Disney, three days after.'
b'But TiVo argues that its ad-skipping feature should be more palatable to the networks, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not automatic. You have to press that D button each time a block of ads comes up. Therefore, TiVo says, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0basically just a streamlined version of fast-forwarding, which is perfectly legal.'
b'TiVo has another weapon, too: Dish was forced into its ad-skipping compromises because it\xe2\x80\x99s also a broadcaster, which TiVo is not. The networks threatened to withdraw Dish\xe2\x80\x99s permission to broadcast their shows\xe2\x80\x94leverage they don\xe2\x80\x99t have against TiVo.'
b'But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the lawyers straighten all that out. For now, the TiVo Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Skip technology works fantastically. The only heartbreaker is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not available on all shows. It\xe2\x80\x99s never available for news or sports; sometimes, it\xe2\x80\x99s even missing from the national primetime ones that are supposed to work. (On my Bolt review unit, ad skipping works great on Fallon, but Colbert\xe2\x80\x99s show isn\xe2\x80\x99t ad-skippable.)'
b'Watch anywhere'
b'If you have a TiVo in one room, you can multiply it to other rooms with the addition of a TiVo Mini ($150, no monthly fee). A Mini connects to a second TV, but shows the contents of the main TiVo elsewhere in the house.'
b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s only the beginning.'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a cluttered but powerful app for TiVo for your iPhone, iPad, or Android gadget. It lets you (1) schedule and manage TiVo recordings from afar, (2) operate as a remote control for the TiVo, (3) view detailed dossiers about actors and movies, (4) play live TV anywhere in the house, (5) play anything your TiVo has recorded anywhere in the house, and (6) download TiVo recordings to your phone or tablet.'
b'That downloading business is great for times when you\xe2\x80\x99ll be without fast Internet (a plane, a raft in the middle of the ocean), or when you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not eat up your cellular data plan. And why '
b'shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t '
b'you be allowed to carry some shows and movies from your cable subscription with you? You\xe2\x80\x99ve paid to watch them, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?'
b'In November, TiVo says, the Bolt will be able to stream '
b'two'
b'Then early next year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to watch your TiVo recordings on the road, from across the Internet. And by the middle of next year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to watch any of your '
b'live '
b'TV channels from the road. In other words, the Bolt will become like the Slingbox.'
b'Life with Bolt'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a hardcore, long-time TiVophile, and I want this thing.\xc2\xa0Its speed, its software layout, its consolidation of both cable and Web services, its playback stunts, its ad skipping, its ability to set your recordings free from the box in the living room\xe2\x80\xa6Now more than ever, TiVo is the closest thing we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to a time machine.'
b'But I also wish the Bolt didn\xe2\x80\x99t have so many footnotes: features coming soon, features that work only on Comcast or Cox, features that work only on 20 channels.'
b'TiVo is working on most of those limitations, of course. Here\xe2\x80\x99s wishing good luck to its engineers, its dealmakers, and its lawyers.'
b'Because you know what? This machine will be awesome, once a few of its quirks get\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94straightened out.'

b'Great picture on my Vizio 4K TV'
b"First thing to notice is the excellent picture. Next thing is the the One Pass feature that let's you select shows for recording the whole season. I don't have much 4K content due to internet bandwidth limitations in my area, but the Tivo Bolt does a much better job of up-converting 1080P content. Also streaming shows are much better on Netflix and Hulu than using the built-in Vizio apps.\nThe only con is I occasionally have a brief blank out of the screen, but I can't say for sure that it is the Tivo or the TV."

b'Nice features'
b'It has nice features but does not seem to stay connected to the tuning adapter as well as previous models do.  I often turn on that TV and have nothing currently on any station as if it cannot see the stations until they are changed and can again hook up with the tuning adapter.\n\nOne would think by this time the SDV problem would have been resolved so no tuning adapter was needed.'

b'Nice TiVo'
b"I have 2 TiVo Premiers and was excited to get a new updated faster TiVo. It is a little faster but I can not call it a Unified Entertainment System. As a stand alone DVR it works good. The DVR is now slower than the Premier DVR after 2 TiVo mini's were paired with it.  I recommend this 4 tunner model only if you use it as a stand alone DVR."

b'Is a CableCARD Really Needed?'
b'\nIf your client does not subscribe to expanded digital cable service, a CableCARD may not be required at all. TiVo Premiere DVRs work with any analog cable (i.e. basic or expanded basic) source right out of the box and, of course, with ATSC antennas (for standard and high definition over-the-air signals). However, in order to receive certain HD and digital channels from the cable provider, a CableCARD is required.'
b'\n'
b'How Do I Get and Install a CableCARD?'
b'\nYour customer will need to request a CableCARD from their cable company. Most will not issue or release the card without the customer\xe2\x80\x99s personal authorization, and some cable companies actually require that one of their technicians come to the home and install the card. However, many cable companies will simply hand over the card for customer installation. Remind the customer that they can actually return the old cable box or DVR and that the CableCARD rental fee, which ranges from free to $11/month, is less expensive than the embedded cable box rental fee they are currently paying.'
b'\nActivating the card:'
b'\nWith the TV on and the cable input connected to the TiVo box, insert the CableCARD into the CableCARD slot (with TiVo Premiere, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the back of the box).'
b'\nWhen the decoder information screen appears, select \xe2\x80\x9cconfigure CableCARD\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cCableCARD menu\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b'\nCall the cable company (if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already) for card initialization \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to provide them with the appropriate numbers from the configuration screen. Be sure to inform the cable company operator that you\xe2\x80\x99re activating a TiVo DVR.'
b'\n'
b'Looking for a simple way to get your video output to multiple displays for your installation?'
b'\n'
b'TiVo has you covered by making all three video outputs \xe2\x80\x93 HDMI, component, and composite, simultaneously \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b'\n'
b'This means you can feed one TiVo box to up to three different displays without the need for splitters \xe2\x80\x93 and if you DO use splitters, the TiVo box carries support for up to 16 HDMI licenses.'

b"SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA -- I've had a TiVo Premiere since 2010; I had a series 2 before then. Earlier this week the cable company made a change in the channel lineup; no big I just have to re-scan on all of the TV's. Unfortunately, my wife went to re-scan on the TiVo and just told it to scan and didn't tell it to delete all the channels. We ended up with duplicate channels; one that works and one that doesn't. "
b'\n'
b"If you're watching live TV it's annoying, but you can keep trying until you hit the one that works; for recording it's a crapshoot if you'll get a blank screen. No big deal, you delete all the channels and then re-scan and it works. Only when you go to hit three thumbs down and hit enter to confirm deleting it just takes you back to the previous screen."
b'\n'
b'So I contact support via chat, their preferred method. They try to blame my network and they want me to "reset my network". When I ask what they mean by that they want me to power cycle my cable modem and wifi router. Keep in mind, I\'m chatting with them online, so this will break the session. Second, why would a TiVo need a network connection to re-scan for channels. As they requested I did restart the TiVo and while it\'s restarting he kept asking if either of the channel scan options worked. '
b'\n'
b"I explained three times that scanning always worked but the option to delete never did. After the third time, when I explain the TiVo is still restarting (it does take forever, but this is TiVo support). He then closes the case and disconnects. Frustrated, I call support and after a half an hour they decide that I should wipe my TiVo and reset it up. I assume that will work, but when I ask about them fixing the channel scan so future changes don't necessitate wasting over half an hour re-entering settings and I'm told there is nothing to fix."
b'\n'
b"I contacted the executive relations team since I had their information from a problem last month and I was basically told I was wrong. Today I got a call back and I was told that the delete option was working as expected. When I asked what the point of having a menu entry that does nothing, she claimed that it would delete the channels. First, it doesn't delete the channels -- and yes I've re-tested that just to confirm. "
b'\n'
b"Second, what's the point of having a DVR with no channels configured (if you were getting rid of it, you'd want to wipe all settings, not just channels). So my expected behavior that it would delete channels and rescan, the behavior that its exhibited for over five years, makes more sense. TiVo's response was just that I'm wrong."
b'\n'
b"This is particularly frustrating as I have had this issue off and on for the last five years. I've open numerous cases about it -- typically explaining that I had resolved my immediate solution by using a different remote, using the android app, or wiping it and starting over. I was told that they have no record of my ever opening a case about this issue. They also said that I never contacted support earlier in the day as there were no open cases. "
b'\n'
b"Since I mentioned contacting them a month ago, on Christmas Eve we most of our channels quit working. Support tried blaming the cable company, but they confirmed that my signal strength was good and I didn't need to re-scan for channels on any of my Tv's or on my MythTV setup. After four hours, only the last hour of which did I see any actual troubleshooting (checking signal strength etc), they said I had two options: buy a new TiVo or get a cable card. They couldn't guarantee that either would work since they didn't know what was wrong. Since they sell a device they are responsible for both the hardware and software, so I didn't find that acceptable. "
b'\n'
b"I eventually talked to someone from their Executive Relations Team who said that a cable card isn't compatible with my current cable package so that's not even an option. He said that I have the newest TiVo that will work with the service that my cable company currently offers. So neither of those were solutions. Since he took weeks to get back to me, I had fixed the problems myself. I'm not sure which steps are necessary, but I un-plugged the TiVo and waited a couple of minutes. "
b'\n'
b"After starting up it did't work. I then deleted and re-scanned for channels (in the one step, that I expected to work this month). Disappointed that we still had the issue of channels not working, I deleted and re-scanned for channels. While that didn't work, it did result in just 15 channels which is about how many were working. "
b'\n'
b"I then went into the menu where you can hide channels that you don't actually get (you might get a signal, but it might be encrypted etc) just to confirm all the channels I should had were still checked. They were, but when I backed out of that menu, there was a long pause. After that, I had all of my channels back. Thus it appears it was a software glitch and that's consistent with none of my other devices having an issue at that time."
b'\n'
b"Throughout this process I was told various things that really convinced me this company just doesn't understand their customers. The best example is when I commented about having to re-scan every couple of months despite none of my other devices needing to indicating that it wasn't a change made by the cable company, I was told that TiVo's require a much strong signal then a TV. That decision was made since they are recording. Also, the signal strength ever drop below that, the TiVo just drops the channel until you re-scan. "
b'\n'
b"Think about that for a second; say you are watching your show and something happens and the cable drops out for five minutes. Instead of just losing that five minutes, you know must re-scan which can take awhile. Why would that be the desired behavior from my perspective? TiVo just argued that it was because you wouldn't want inconsistent recordings, but I'd argue something is better than nothing. There are other issue like I don't get any program data for my HD-channels. TiVo has said it's my cable provider's fault for not providing proper information on those channels. That may be true, but SchedulesDirect gets it correct for my MythTV box."
b'\n'
b"At the end of the day, my MythTV setup has been more reliable, less work to setup and maintain (and that's with SchedulesDirect refusal to automatic renew, so there's a manual renewal every year), it has more features (you can have multiple backends -- that is tuners -- and multiple frontends that all cooperate), and overall is just a better product. "
b'\n'
b'Even the lack of customer service is an improvement over the TiVo\'s customer support whose actions scream "Please don\'t be our customer", who have yet to solve one of my problems, and who have REALLY annoyed me (seriously, get them some basic customer service training -- interrupting me every time I try to talk is not cool).'

b'I am very displeased by your service... Brief summary... Check case**. I bought a DVR from Walmart, the device was defected so I had to return the item even though I wasted a lot of time. Waited approximately 10 days for the new device... Received it yesterday, I was unable to change the TSN in my account on the web. Thus had to call in. This is what I was told..."When you placed your order via the website, the order and details of the order were placed in an older customer database (this took over 45 minutes to figure the issue)." After talking to a supposed manager the solution was..."We have escalated your ticket to be resolved ASAP but I have no idea how long that will take."'
b'\n'
b'I was on the phone for 75+ minutes trying to become a CUSTOMER!!! RIDICULOUS!!! Today I get home and tried use the device because I receive an email with a survey on my experience... I am still unable to use the services I paid for weeks ago!!! I also paid for a full year!!! I asked for a refund and this was not an option. I am fed up and will be posting this in every avenue possible as I sit here on hold for 10+ mins... I also received an email saying my email address has been changed. NOW I CANNOT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT...'

b"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- I have been a subscriber to TiVo's service since 2001, and I would have considered myself one of their greatest advocates... until recently. Now, I am fast becoming one of their greatest detractors. I upgraded to the TiVo Premiere in July 2010. It worked fine... until TiVo deployed its updates. Although TiVo's Marketing Director suspects I received a defective unit, the machine worked perfectly for about 1-1 1/2 years before gradual deterioration set in, following a major software update. "
b'\n'
b'I will be the first to admit that, when it works properly, TiVo is phenomenal. BUT, when it FAILS, one has no other recourse but to launch the machine from a catapult atop a tall skyscraper. If your TiVo unit fails, and you have filled it with (hundreds of) hours of recorded programs, you will be faced with the following ultimatum: Cough up another $250-$400 to replace your machine and LOSE all your recorded programs; or, retain your recorded programs and learn to live with an expensive \xe2\x80\x93 and bulky \xe2\x80\x93 paperweight. Unless you plan to continue paying the monthly service fee for the second unit, once deactivated, your old unit will lose all its recordings. '
b'\n'
b"So, if you have accumulated a volume of recorded programs and, especially if you added the DVR Expander for additional recording capacity, you will be wishing you hadn't if you ever have to replace your machine. Oh, and don't even consider TiVo's networking feature of transferring programs between machines \xe2\x80\x93 most programming, these days, is copyright-protected and, as such, these programs may NOT be transferred between TiVo DVRs, even if they reside within the same household. Perhaps TiVo should change its slogan to: \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo \xe2\x80\x93 OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY!\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'\n'
b'BEWARE, if you begin to experience the following: '

b'Recently, I recorded a movie at midnight. When I awoke the next morning, I looked for my recording in the "My Shows" list but, guess what? It wasn\'t there, so I reviewed my recording history and, sure enough, there it was listed as "Deleted"; according to TiVo, it was deleted because its time had expired and the space was required for another program. '
b'\n'
b'It provided an exact time for that other program, but NOTHING was recorded at that given time on my TiVo; in fact, NOTHING AT ALL was scheduled or recorded after the deleted midnight program, and my TiVo indicated that I still had 24 hours of space available for recordings (the deleted program was a mere 2 hours).'
b'\n'
b'Ironically, TiVo now requires more micromanagement from me than the old TV/VCR combination ever did! Back then, I could set my VCR to record something, come home from work (or wake up in the morning) and... voila!... my recording would still be on the tape and would play back beautifully. Hmmm... Technology is good; progress not so...'
b'\n'
b'Oh, and on another note, TiVo service in my area was down for several hours on two separate occasions. I contacted TiVo\'s so-called "customer service", only to have what I already knew confirmed. They assured me that my bill would be discounted for those lost hours, but did I see any such discount on either respective bill? In a word, NO! TiVo reps are NOT TO BE TRUSTED. I\'ve got a life, but TiVo just doesn\'t get it!'
b'\n'
b'My biggest beef with TiVo (and other DVR services) is that, ten years ago, I paid $400 for a DirecTV/TiVo DVR and I OWNED the machine. I did not have to return it to TiVo, because it was COMPLETELY MY OWN PROPERTY. Now, one still has to fork over roughly the same amount, but the machines are leased ( i.e. NOT owned) by the consumer.'
b'\n'
b'And this brings me to my next point: I still OWN my 1st and 2nd TiVo DVRs, on which I can continue to view my recorded programs, even if their recording capability is no longer available. It\'s similar to having a library of DVDs without taking up valuable shelf space. But, after deactivation, the recorded programs on the TiVo Premiere will be no longer accessible. People "buy" DVRs, obviously, to record hours of programming, so they can "watch television when they want to watch it". '
b'\n'
b"In what world does it make sense, then, to require people to return (or deactivate) their machine when they need to replace it with a new one, only to lose hundreds of hours of programming? So much for watching \xe2\x80\x9cTV your way\xe2\x80\x9d. In a nutshell, TiVo lets you watch TV when it decides to let you watch TV. In an analogous situation, should I be paying a monthly fee to Sony? After all, I still own and view my VHS tapes, loaded with programs recorded using my Sony VCR. (And, actually, many of the programs on my old VHS tapes look 10x better than the same programs recorded off digital cable/satellite \xe2\x80\x93 I've tried both \xe2\x80\x93 onto my TiVo DVRs)."
b'\n'
b'I do have to give some credit to the Marketing Director for his response to a similar review I posted elsewhere and for his efforts but, on behalf of TiVo, he cannot offer an amenable solution to my situation. Suspecting my current TiVo unit to be defective, he sent me a replacement machine, on the basis that I would transfer the programs from my old machine to the replacement and, then, return the old unit to him. And he gave me two months overlap time, for both machines to remain activated, to do so before returning the old machine. This would have been no problem, if I could actually transfer my hundreds of hours of recorded programming between machines. '
b'\n'
b"All the programs on my current machine, however, appear to be copyright-protected, so they cannot be transferred from one machine to another, even if both machines reside in the same household ( i.e. on the same network). And, thanks to TiVo's heavy promotion of its large capacity hard drives (Record up to 300 HD hours with TiVo\xc2\xae Premiere XL4! - Now with 4 tuners, so you can record even more shows!), and the DVR Expander, I have accumulated over 1400 hours of SD programming on my DVR. If I were to keep the new machine, I would lose all that recorded programming! "
b'\n'
b'I, even, offered to pay the additional monthly service fee for the second machine, if I could keep both machines until I clear the old machine of its programming (by either viewing the shows or re-recording them on the new unit - though many of the shows are rarely re-broadcast and still many more will never be re-broadcast). '
b'\n'
b'So, after just 2 years of service on my current TiVo DVR, it looks like I will have to fork over yet an additional $250.00 PLUS an additional monthly fee for TiVo service on a second machine, just so that I can record on a (hopefully) properly working DVR, while still retaining the hundreds of hours of programming that I have recorded on my current DVR. On second thought, perhaps I will simply request a new generic DVR from Time Warner Cable (after all, the unit itself is essentially free, since I will only have to pay the monthly service fee, and I had initially returned their DVR when I received my TiVo Premiere) and FORGET TIVO ALTOGETHER!'
b'\n'
b"IN CONCLUSION, BEWARE: If you are anything like me, and you record a lot of programs on your DVR, you'd better hope and pray that your TiVo NEVER fails. Mine lasted only about 1 1/2 years before it began to deteriorate, thanks to bad software programming/deployment and/or a defective machine. Now, capitalism rears its ugly head as I must empty my wallet again for the sake of TiVo and my own sanity. TiVo - and Capitalism - wins again!"

b'\n'
b'\n'
b"A fair warning about TiVo and why TiVo sucks. Short version: I paid for a lifetime subscription. TiVo cancelled my account, claimed I called and cancelled, and claimed they credited my account. I never called and cancelled my account and they never issued a credit to my credit card. Now I have a useless TiVo machine with no service and I'm out over $300."
b'\n'
b'Details: I used to always brag about TiVo and have purchased 6 TiVo machines. I have been a TiVo customer for years and currently have three TiVo boxes "running." I have to put quotes around running since TiVo took it upon themselves to turn off one of them, which I paid a lifetime subscription for. I received and email warning and I emailed back to TiVo and even attached screenshot showing I had a lifetime subscription and never received any response. They proceeded to shut off my box. I then had the pleasure of calling TiVo. Should you ever call them, be prepared to be on hold forever. '
b'\n'
b'After giving up on two previous occasions, I finally planned my day around it and was able to get through after about 20 minutes of being on hold. The customer service representative was less than helpful. He claimed I called and cancelled my account, which I had not. I explained I had a lifetime subscription and he insisted I cancelled my account and claimed my credit card was credited. My credit card was never credited and I explained that. He then claimed their records showed they issued me a credit and he blamed my credit card company and said I had to take it up with them. I called my credit card company and they confirmed I never received a credit from TiVo.'
b'\n'
b"I got online with TiVo, which still took about 30 minutes to get a representative. The guy looked at my account and agreed something did not look correct; however, he would have to send it to a supervisor to look at. Even though he did absolutely nothing to rectify the problem, except pass it along, he seemed helpful. He told me someone would call me and I asked if they would leave a message with a number I could call back without being on hold forever, since I don't answer calls I don't recognize, since they're oftentimes sales calls. He said they would leave a number that was a direct line. Did they ever call and so much as leave a message? No."
b'\n'
b"Bottom line: TiVo can take your money, claim you cancelled, claim they refunded your money, and leave you with a useless TiVo box and out hundreds of dollars. But they'll make sure they wait a few months, so you don't even have recourse with your credit card company. TiVo SUCKS."

b'Before entering into a relationship with TV (tee-voh), carefully consider the difficulty you will most certainly encounter when it inevitably comes time to "break up" with TiVo. After 2 and 1/2 years of being generally satisfied with the service, we realized that our casual and rare use of the service no longer warranted spending the monthly fee to keep it.'
b'\n'
b'After calling to cancel the service the day my account was billed for the NEXT month\'s service, I had to go round and round with their customer "service" department to cancel the account and get refunded the charge. The charge was indeed refunded in the customer un-friendly time frame of 10-14 days as promised, but unbeknownst to me, the customer "service" representative neglected to actually cancel the account.'
b'\n'
b'So the next month upon noticing an additional monthly charge from TV on my charge account, I contacted the customer "service" department to demand an immediate refund and an explanation for the *unauthorized* access to my card. After 45 minutes on the phone with 3 customer "service" reps including a floor supervisor, I have a cancellation effective NEXT month and a credit coming back to me within the next 10-14 business days. It\'s interesting to me how they can easily process an incorrect - and unauthorized - charge on a Saturday afternoon, but they are unable to apply the corrective refund "because it is a Sunday".'
b'\n'
b'This is a prime example of what I consider a customer disservice provided by an customer "service" department whose sole purpose is to provide a buffer between the customer and the people who create the policies and procedures that generate the dissatisfaction that I and many other TV EX-customers have experienced. Instead of being a highly dissatisfied TV ex-customer, I wish I had known this so that I could have saved myself the aggravation and not been a TV customer at all.'

b'TiVo Series 3 - The Truth Is Out There'
b'\n'
b'By '

b'\n'
b'\n'
b"NEW JERSEY -- Like many others - I was delighted with my Series 3 when I bought it in late October 2007 - with the original hefty pricetag. Despite some initial install problems (cable company at the time not comprehending cable cards) - once I got up and running I didn't look back."
b'\n'
b"That's until late Jan/early Feb of this year when my S3 began simply coming apart at the seams. Freezing, Rebooting, GSODs etc. Like many others because you have an S3 with cable cards.. the S3 going down leaves you with nothing to fall back on. Despite constant running around replacing HDs, cable cards, cables etc.. all known possible fixes provided by support.. still problems that eventually leaves you feeling like you've just been kicked to the curb with Tivo moving on and no longer caring about their S3 customers. In fact you end up feeling like a nuisance rather than a valued customer."
b'\n'
b"After reaching out to other S3 owners. The amount of users having the same problems with their S3's after a roughly 12-14 month period simply astounds me. (If you don't believe me do a google search for Tivo series 3 problems). It really makes me question why the S3 was indeed discontinued.. did Tivo simply get tired of replacing them or handling the endless tech problems? True Tivo can't do enough for you when you are a perspective buyer or a new customer.. but once youve become a long term customer with problems-they are suddenly a lot less unresponsive."
b'\n'
b"True, maybe the new Tivo HDs are a lot better.. maybe its only those unfortunate enough to own an S3 who'll be left behind with now very expensive doorstops.. but regardless, based on my own experience.. I will not be looking to Tivo in the future for my DVR needs. Which is sad because I really do believe it was originally a great product and service. But once things went bad with the S3.. and they obviously did.. the number of people left out in cold, and brushed aside after spending so much hard earned money is simply inexcusable, even from a once great company like Tivo."

b'SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA -- I bought a new TIVO and when I activated it I didn\'t realize I had to call and ask them to cancel service on my old TIVO. I recently realized they have been double billing me for 16 months and when I called to ask them to refund the money from the 2nd billing, they told me that was "against our policy at TIVO." The staff members I talked to (about 5 people total) were all rather arrogant and refused to help me at all because of their "policies."'
b'\n'
b"The customer service at TIVO is evidently much worse than that at Comcast, a feat I didn't think was possible. I wonder how long this company will be around given the competition for the consumer dollar and MUCH BETTER customer service almost anywhere else. I used to rave about TIVO. No more. Now I'm warning people against it. There are much better options, such as On Demand and other DVRs."

b'I signed up for Tivo\'s month to month service, specifically because it said no commitment. My account still says on it no commitment. I called to cancel because my service does not work, and it doesn\'t record. When I call to cancel they said that by "No Commitment" my service plan meant "no commitment AFTER a year long commitment." That they were sorry they made the mistake of putting "No Commitment" on the account, but that that was "no more dishonest than what cell phone companies do." '
b'\n'
b'Tivo is pulling a classic bait and switch, call it "no commitment" even though they ADMIT that it is in fact an iron clad commitment to their service. Their early termination fee of $200 was more than the ENTIRE year long plan that THEY signed me up to. To them NO commitment means that\'s your plan after a commitment. I was ripped off. '

b'Let me start off by saying I have been a loyal customer of TIVO since 2006 and have gone to battle many times with friends, co-workers and even strangers, making strong justifications that TIVO was worth the extra cost. Not anymore. The box I purchased back in 2010 has been acting up, so I called customer service to see if there was any cheaper options for longtime customers to purchase the Roamio than the big bucks listed on the website. I was told I could get a whopping $20 of the cheapest $199 option but that there were no other discount or upgrade options for the mid-grade or high-grade Roamio boxes.'
b'\n'
b"I spoke to the CS agent about cancelling my service and she seemed to think that was OK and didn't care either way. Is this really how TIVO thinks it's going to keep customers now that they have all this competition? I am sorely disappointed in my interaction with this company today... and will be cancelling my service."

b"JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY -- I purchased DVR F481 in December 2009. I upgraded to DVR 45C8 in November 2009 but failed to cancel the old service because it wasn't clearly apparent to me that upgrading to a new device would mean to cancel service on the old. I discarded DVR F481. Then in 2011, I upgraded again to DVR 7D92 and discarded DVR 45C8. Again not realizing that I needed to cancel the old service. So as of today, I have paid TIVO close to $1,330.56 in service fees of old devices that were discarded. Yes, you have a policy to call to cancel, I understand that now, however it is not a logical process nor did any of the written material stress this point. "
b'\n'
b"From a customer service perspective, TIVO should have offered me either to credit my account or reimburse me the service fees, but you have refused. I also found many other former customers complain about this practice. Some even called to cancel old devices but the cancellation didn't go through and they were subsequently charged for months of service. That says to me that TIVO is OK with making sure people keep paying them for service that they can't even use. Beware."

b"I have complained previously about the TiVo box I have taping programmes not asked for or taping programmes you have asked to be taped for half the time instead of the whole programme. Previous calls have been with a call centre outside the UK and I have done exactly as they've asked this being to reboot the machine but this has not solved the problem. All I want to do is speak with someone in a UK call centre and for the TiVo box to actually work. I pay hard earned cash for this but get dreadful customer care! I was told by the agent tonight that I would have to pay for a new box but why should I when the one they've given me is kaput!!"

I thought my account covered whichever version of TIVO I happened to own. Well I learned the hard way (and the $$$ way) that this is not the case. You have to call and cancel your old service in order to avoid being billed twice, even if you only have one box. TIVO has been double billing me for 16 months and once I realized it, I talked to several different people, all of whom steadfastly refused to refund the money from the..."

b'Tivo "LIFETIME" SERVICE IS A RIPOFF!!! It sounds good at first, but the lifetime is only for the lifetime of the box. If it dies prematurely, tough luck, apparently. TIVO will charge a LOT of money to transfer the subscription to a replacement box, even if they\'re the ones doing the replacement! My box died at 2 years. Tivo will replace it for $149, but also wants $199 to transfer the subscription to the new box.\n\nTivo has been losing customers left and right...their subscription base keeps declining each financial quarter. They may not exist in a few years. I understand their desire to...'

After spending several months trying to find a workaround (this was not a high priority in my life), I finally realized that the TIVO would not work. When I tried to cancel the service, I was informed that cancellation after 30 days was not possible due to company policy. Needless to say this was news to me. The agent agreed that my inability to connect TIVO and all of the related problems were documented.\n\nI explained I physically could not use the...'

b'After subscribing to TIVO service for 6 1/2 years, my TIVO box crashed. No repair service was available, as the box was no longer in production. No concession was offered; I would have to buy a new box for around $400. I cancelled the service and switched to Comcast on 2/20/2011. The TIVO rep told me he would give me 2 months free service to "think about it" in case I didn\'t like Comcast. I said I would get I would get back to him if I wanted to reconsider. TIVO resumed debiting my account for April and May. I called demanding a refund for both months, because I was being charged for a...'

b'There is a web site for customers to contact the CEO of TiVo Inc. who are not satisfied with the assistance provided by the customer service department. I wrote the attached letter to the CEO this past Sunday and have not received an answer. I am currently looking for other disgruntled customers who are interested in filing a class action suit against TiVo for dishonest billing practices. I have spoken to a few lawyer friends and there are grounds to challenge the terms and conditions they site gives them the right to keep money for services they know they did not render. My next step is to...'

b"Purchased an upgrade to the HD Series 3 unit. Actually was defective and failed within a couple weeks. Was told had to pay for shipping of replacement unit and had to pay in advance for the replacement (which really is NOT supportive on how the warranty is covered). When I got the new unit, I was convinced to accept the 90 day grace period to remove all the content from the box and sell or give to someone - not fully disclosing that it starts billing again...!! Then, they won't credit back up to those months it started, and additionaly, state they have a 90 day credit back billing dispute..."

b'I signed up for TIVO and then found it impossible to install on my system. Took hours on the phone trying to reach them withoout success. I have been charged fdor several months without receiving any service. Then my credit card went stale dated and I thought that woluld be an end to it - but instead they said they had cut off service (which is what I wanted), place my account with a colelction agency and charge me a $200 early cancellation fee.\n\nTher seems to be no way to contact them buy email - which seems to be intentional so you cannot commujnicate and they can continue to bill.\n\nDoes anyone know how to contact them by email?'

b'When I purchased my Tivo boxes I was assured that my privacy settings would be respected. I told them how I wanted them set and was assured again that they would be. To my surprise about 6 months later I learned that when you initially set up your Tivo box it automaticly sets you up for a less restricting privacy setting then you were originally told it would be. When I called to find out what happened I was told that I could have easily reset my privacy to the strictest setting by going to messages/settings at the time I set up my box. I pointed out that their were no such instructions to do...'

b'I purchased a Tivo in February. On occasion the video is just freeze. At first I reset (cycled the power) it, but later found that the menu system worked and I could reset it that way. Sometimes just doing a channel up/down would cause it to work. This all tells me that the basic unit is working but that the video interface is getting hung up.\n\nI called customer service to ask for an exchange. I was given all types of reasons that it could hang - low signal, strong signal, etc. I finally asked for a supervisor. After 25 minutes (!!) the same representative came back(!!).\n\nHe advised me on doing...'

b'I called TIVO to cancel there service coonectiong to FIOS, but that I would be moving to a new location which did not have FIOS. At that time I might use TIVO. The lady said I would recieve three months free service if I reconnected at new location, but after three months they started billing me. I have not moved still use HD FIOS and billed for TIVO for a service that is not connected. They are able to tell if the service is connected, try and connect a box, without calling them it does not work.'

b'My Tivo unit refused to update its software. When I called in about this, I was told they would exchange the unit for $50 and my lifetime subscription would transfer.\n\nForward 2 years because there were many family problems and a move to another state. I call back in and now all of a sudden the fee is $349 PLUS I have to pay for service all over again.\n\nI cannot afford that.\n\nShame on Tivo for gouging the public. Since you do not stand behind the products you sell and try to make more money off those of us who already paid for a lifetime subscription by denying it when your box refuses to...'

b'They were not capable of making a simple credit card information update wich resulted in me having to call over six times and loosing many of my recordings. Not only were they not able to fix a simple problem but the make you wait over an hour just to get to the right person. And after you get to the "right" person, they keep putting you on hold until you\'re reduced to tears from frustration.\n\nThe president of this company should fire everyone in customer service and hire more qualified people.\n\nI will think twice about purchasing any service or equipment from tivo unless you feel like being treated like dirt.'

b'I was given a Tivo for Christmas, I have had the service for 6 months. When first trying to connect to the service to download the guide, I could not get it to connect for the life of me. I called their tech support and they told me a code to use as my dialing prefix. Perfect the service connected and downloaded. \n\nAfter about a month I was getting sick of running a phone cord from one end of my home to the other to connect just so I could have a guide, because I did not have wireless internet at the time. So I recently switched internet companies so I could have a wireless connection. I went to...'

b"In Feb 2009 my TIVO DVR stopped changing the channel on the Direct TV satellite box. I spent hours on the phone with both companies but there seemed to be no solution. TIVO had me purchase a IR booster from Radio Shack but that did not work. After having a TIVO that didn't work for four months I finally called to cancel my service ($12.95 a month) and they told me I had a contract for another year and I would be billed $150 for canceling. Since their product does not work it seems odd that I have to continue paying for nothing. This company is dishonest."

b"After paying for a 1-year subscription to service, the TIVO stopped working. Seems like a normal enough thing to me, so I cancelled my cable (because I don't watch a lot of TV), and went on my merry way. Didn't think that I would continue to be charged $12.95 a month for service I wasn't using. Well, I thought wrong. 14 months later, when I called about the problem, I was told that in my 1-year service agreement, somewhere in there, it told me that I would be automatically renewed to monthly service, without my permission. Beware, customers, because TIVO cannot give refunds, or so I am told. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this?"

b'After being a 4 year customer with TiVo and not one missed payment, they refused to credit my account for the monthly payment that they sent through AFTER we cancelled our account!! Their customer service is the WORST I have ever experienced through ANY company and I have had some bad experiences. The supervisor was rude, uncaring and a disgrace to the job title. Beware and NEVER get TiVo through a bank draft!!! And PRAY you never need to talk with their horrific customer service department.'
