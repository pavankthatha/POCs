\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOf the 40 or so shows we\'ve recorded on our new Bolt, about 10% have the "Skip" feature.
\r\nIs this one of those "read the tiny print" features they use to boost sales of the product?\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt only applies to 20 networks for shows aired between 4:00-12:00.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's limited, but that certainly doesn't make it a scam."
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo be fair, the first presentation of the feature on the Bolt product page is seemingly definitive: "Commercial killer. The only thing more annoying than commercials is having to fast-forward through them every 10 minutes. Now skip over entire commercial breaks at the press of a button."
\nYou have to go one level deeper to see the description of the feature: "The idea of skipping entire commercial breaks at the press of a button has me feeling all tingly inside. How exactly does SkipMode&#8482; work? SkipMode is available when you\'re watching a recorded show. Although not all shows will be available with the SkipMode feature, we\'ve taken great pains to ensure we\'re covering most of the channels that most people in the TiVo community record a lot."
\nThen you have to go one level deeper to get the full story: "The SkipMode feature is available on the top 20 most-watched networks and more channels will be added in the future. The shows that will be SkipMode-enabled are those that appear during the most common recording hours: seven days a week, between the hours of 4:00 pm and midnight (12:30 am for late night talk shows airing on ABC, NBC and CBS)."
\nI think that\'s fair, but arguably they could have made that first presentation say, "Commercial killer. The only thing more annoying than commercials is having to fast-forward through them every 10 minutes. Now skip over entire commercial breaks during prime time on the top twenty networks at the press of a button." There wasn\'t even an asterisk or other indication that there were limitations, in the first presentation of the feature, as they have it now. However, that\'s really picking nits imho.\n\t\t\t\t\t
It only applies to 20 networks for shows aired between 4:00-12:00.
"Even that seems misleading. Since it's really 7pm to midnight Eastern Time. And the 4PM comes from Pacific time.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"Even that seems misleading. Since it's really 7pm to midnight Eastern Time. And the 4PM comes from Pacific time."
"If I'm not mistaken, I believe it is 4pm to midnight Eastern Time (12:30am Eastern Time for the Tonight Show and the Late Show since they run past midnight).\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe point I think Aaron is raising is what is being processed between 4pm and 7pm Eastern Time?\n\t\t\t\t\t
he point I think Aaron is raising is what is being processed between 4pm and 7pm Eastern Time?
s far as I can tell nothing.  They do not do the ABC, CBS, or NBC evening news which is on at 6:30. Does anyone on the East cost actually have shows they record between 4pm & 7pm that have SkipMode enabled?\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI'll double check but I'm pretty certain I have a number of recordings that should have fallen under the 20 channel/time slot and still didn't have commercial skip enabled."
\r\nDoes Skip need to have contact with the Tivo servers at the time of the recording?  My Bolt is constantly doing the spinning icon/Tivo service not available error.
"\r\nAnd it's not a network issue on my side...\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI thought the approach they were using would require access to the TiVo server at time of playback, not at time of recording. Not sure though.\n\t\t\t\t\t
I thought the approach they were using would require access to the TiVo server at time of playback, not at time of recording. Not sure though.
I am guessing the Bolt needs to have a good connection to the TiVo Servers throughout the evening.  SkipMode shows up usually within a few minutes of the end of a show so the data must be being sent throughout the evening.  If someone wants to pull the network connection for a day and then see if SkipMode is enabled after they reconnect please do so and post back the results.\n\t\t\t\t\t
s far as I can tell nothing.  They do not do the ABC, CBS, or NBC evening news which is on at 6:30. Does anyone on the East cost actually have shows they record between 4pm & 7pm that have SkipMode enabled?
I do and none of them have skip. Starting at 7pm on the East Coast I get shows with the Skip function.\n\t\t\t\t\t

"They don't do live or local content. The news falls under both. Locally syndicated programming falls under the later. So I think the only thing that would qualify between 4pm and primetime would be nationally syndicated shows. "
\r\nLooking at the schedules for the big 4 networks the only show I see listed as being nationally syndicated is Judge Judy on NBC. Everything else is local programming before 7pm.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've had reruns of Modern Family on the local Fox station between 7pm and 8pm show up with Skip. Although I've only seen a few of them with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I've had reruns of Modern Family on the local Fox station between 7pm and 8pm show up with Skip. Although I've only seen a few of them with it."
"From what I've seen they use a content ID for the episode to generate the skip points, and IIRC Modern Family also plays on USA, so maybe the skip points were generated for USA and just happen to be the same episodes played by your local affiliate. "
\r\nIf that is how it works then this whole thing should get more robust, especially with reruns, over time.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've seen Skip appear on random channels at random times also... A local independent station has Skip on many old Judge Judy reruns, but the major Fox affiliate with new episodes doesn't. Go figure. Those tags must be getting repurposed."
"\nBut basically anything that isn't part of a national schedule is going to get hosed."
"\nI don't know what the excuse is for the hit and miss of national stations like TBS, Comedy Central, and others though. Does Tivo only watch a show once, and if the markers don't line up (due to speeding up the video or whatever) they just ignore it?\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I don't know what the excuse is for the hit and miss of national stations like TBS, Comedy Central, and others though. Does Tivo only watch a show once, and if the markers don't line up they ignore it?"
From what I can tell they use two lists. One is a segment list with each segment of the show expressed as a start and end point aligned to some clock that is specific to the machine that recorded the episode they used to mark those points. The second list is a hash of all the captions in the recording aligned to that same clock. 
"\nMy assumption as to how it works is that while the episode is being recorded your TiVo hashes the captions using the same algorithm. They then try to match those hashes to the hashes in the list sent with the cut data. If they match then they use their positions to offset the segments in the data to match the timecodes of your recording. I'm not 100% sure if they do it for each segment individually, allowing for different commercial lengths between broadcasters, or if they require a match across the entire show and if one segment doesn't line up they just drop the data completely. Based on the inconsistency some are seeing I'd guess the later.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"They don't do live or local content. The news falls under both. Locally syndicated programming falls under the later. So I think the only thing that would qualify between 4pm and primetime would be nationally syndicated shows. "
\r\nLooking at the schedules for the big 4 networks the only show I see listed as being nationally syndicated is Judge Judy on NBC. Everything else is local programming before 7pm.
"I guess the National news might be live but I don't see how it is local.  Do they actually do separate broadcasts for the east & west costs?  I thought it was just repeated at the correct local time.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I guess the National news might be live but I don't see how it is local.  Do they actually do separate broadcasts for the east & west costs?  I thought it was just repeated at the correct local time."
"I was thinking local news. But yeah even the national news is live, so that's probably why it's not included."
"\nThe reason they probably don't do live.... captioning in live feeds is inconsistent and typically replaced by real captions on subsequent airings. If they are using the captioning data to align the segments, as I suspect they are, then this would effect that.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt seems skip isn't ready for prime time. Tivo almost comes off desperate by pushing it so hard yet not delivering consistently."
\r\nThey are trying to be Apple so hard, without the chops, and it is resulting in more hype than substance.\n\t\t\t\t\t

ew TiVo DVR will skip through commercials
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break."
Interesting....  perhaps there is something they can trigger off of?

"It is pretty interesting that back in the day, when the Tivo vs ReplayTV war was going on that ReplayTV was offering commercial skip and the networks howled, so Tivo refused to offer commercial skip, and that tipped the scales in Tivo's favor. Now this looks like an act of desperation on Tivo's part."

o, they actually stated this is done via humans marking the skip points - which is why it is only for the "top 20" channels and prime time showings.
eems nuts to do it this way, but perhaps there is some legal subtlety they are working around.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."

he problem with Replay was they actually had a really good working system for commercial detection and autoskip .. Sadly I still have my replay units in storage.. I have just been in denial for years they are gone.. that and they wont work with the new encrypted cable systems now.

I have one in the basement, and yes, I agree, the commercial skip worked EXTREMELY well.

o Commercial Skip on FX and others in packaged streaming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe elephant-in-the-room in cable-like streaming packages with cloud DVR capabilities like PSVue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, etc., is that you cannot FF/Skip through commercials on a number of key cable channels. There are variations that confuse, but for example the Fox-owned channels like FX clearly are not allowing commercial-skipping.
"\nSo far I have been unable to find a tech news or cordcutting blog source which honestly reports this fact and provides lists noting the commercial mandatory channels. All over the web there are comparisons between the services that imply the cloud DVR's are the same as cable/satellite services with DVR's."
\nFor those of us who went through the fights (including court cases) for the right to record and skip, even if we did so vicariously as observers, the reality of streaming packages makes so-called "cord-cutting" a less-than-optimum method of TV service.
\nThis does not apply to actual commercial-free streaming sources with network shows like Hulu and CBS All Access or other sources for prior seasons of shows on Netflix. The fact is CBS All Access offers ad-free streaming for all CBS shows including originals. Hulu offers ad-free streaming for almost all ABC, Fox, and NBC broadcast network shows, plus Hulu originals and a few cable channel shows.
\nThere are other options than cable-like streaming packages with cloud DVR capabilities like PSVue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, etc. if you don\'t watch that many regular cable channel shows. For example, in the case of Amazon Prime Video which has no commercials, Seasons 1-4 of the FX show "The Americans" are available for viewing. The currently airing Season 5 is also available for $2.99 an episode or $34.99 ($1.99 an episode if you\'re ok with the so-called SD feed). On the other hand any episode/season of the FX show "Fargo" must be purchased. But remember that the cheapest cable-like streaming packages with cloud DVR capabilities like PSVue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, etc. requires a monthly fee equal to at least 10 episodes of shows purchased through Amazon!\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI haven't tried streaming FX, but just tried a totally unscientific test that reveals nothing. I watched part of Two and a Half Men on FX via TiVo, starting before a commercial break and ending a while after the break. I then backspaced to a point before the commercial break and fast forwarded through the break back to the program. Of course, there was no problem. Don't know how things would work if I tried streaming a show, but I'm certain that if I recorded something from FX on my TiVo, there would be no problem with fast forwarding through a commercial. As to a commercial skip feature, such as on the new TiVo Bolt, I don't know how it would work. "
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI use PSVue and I have never not been able to FF thru commercials on any of the shows that I DVR. One of the shows we are currently DVR'ing is Fargo on FX. We have had no problems at all FF'ing thru commercials watching the DVR'ed episodes of Fargo.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI too have had no problem FF through commercials on PSVUE.  I watch The Americans and Fargo with no problem. Are you sure these are DVR'd and not On Demand versions?\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these FF and skipping shenanigans would ruin the watching experience for me. I just stick to what is commercial free and am a very happy camper.\n\t\t\t\t\t
ll these FF and skipping shenanigans would ruin the watching experience for me. I just stick to what is commercial free and am a very happy camper.
"This is true. After a meaningful period of streaming most of our viewing content without commercials, along with a small amount of DVR'd regular cable content on our Dish system using the skip button, my wife said it's much better to watch without commercial interruptions because your focus isn't interrupted."
\nWe can tolerate a commercial before and one after which apparently Hulu had to do for "Grey\'s Anatomy" and which, weirdly enough, PBS does. But once you\'ve experienced no-interruption-TV, it\'s hard to tolerate the commercials.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI am considering a move to a streaming service when my  cable contract expires. I have read different accounts of the ad skipping capabilities of a  streaming DVR. Some articles indicate that almost none of the shows can be ad skipped. Other articles state that some can be ad skipped. It supposedly has to do with licensing agreements with the broadcasters. My question is, why would they have a different agreement for streaming than they would for cable/sat? My main interest in ad skipping is for sports viewing. Watching a sporting event without ad and halftime skipping is unbearable, not to mention a huge waste of time. Does anyone know if ad skipping works on live sports channels such as ESPN?\n\t\t\t\t\t

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI have a new HDVR2.  Other than using the 3 fast forward speeds, are there other/better ways to skip over commercials?\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile playing back a recording, press Select-Play-Select-3-0-Select. This will change the "move to next tick" function to a 30 second skip.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\nWhat Mark described is called an Easter Egg feature.  This means that it isn't activated by default.  Technically, broadcasters don't like you skipping past commercials.   A lawsuit was filed against Replay TV for having that feature and advertising it.  TiVo decided not to advertise it.  However, they do allow activation of this feature."
\nIn saying all this, remember this process as you will have to repeat it anytime the receiver is reset, whether it is on purpose, due to a TiVo software upgrade or update, or due to a power failure.  Also, this easter egg is not guaranteed to be in future versions of the TiVo software.
"\nCongrats on your purchase of the HDVR2.  Hopefully, your receiver has already downloaded the latest patch to avoid dropouts.  You will know if it has by selecting Messages/Setup and Selecting System Information.  For the receiver model number, it will display HDVR3 (why?  I'm not sure--probably an oversight of the programmers).  As to the commercial skip, you will enjoy the function.  I sure do.  Welcome to the world of TiVo addicts...I mean supporters.   "
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks - what do you mean by "move to next tick function", i.e. which button is that?
While playing back a recording, press Select-Play-Select-3-0-Select. This will change the "move to next tick" function to a 30 second skip.

"I tried that and occasionally would find myself 30 seconds into the program I was watching because I had done one too many 'ticks'."
"\nI finally determined what worked best for me was to use the second of the fast forwards and as soon as I saw the program I was watching come up, hit play and (if I remember rightly, when you do this it goes back 8 seconds), it'll start playing just as the program starts again."
"\nOnce in a while I'll screw up, but most of the time it works for me.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJust a comment - I assumed the TIVO had this feature.  Just another reason the UltimateTV is such a good unit even though the quit making it.  It has a 30 second skip button (actually only 29 sec to give you a sec to look for the start of a commercial or program) and a 7 second back button to use if you go to far.  
\nMS finally had a great product and no one cared.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\nLike others have said, other companies have been sued for having the 30 second commercial skip feature.  Tivo DOES have this feature and it's easy to activate, they just don't advertise it so they don't get sued as well."
\nBy the way, I think UTV was a good product too and I thought they sold rather well.  Microsoft just chose to kill it.  Not a fault of the product, just MS decided they didn\'t want to make it anymore and wanted to roll the technology into the next generation X-Box so they can have that "all in one" media box they\'ve wanted for long time to be your "portal" to all your entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t
hanks - what do you mean by "move to next tick function", i.e. which button is that?
(Checking manual... quite handy... if you lost yours, there is a 
\nIf you pre-recorded a program or a movie, you notice that on the green bar, there are "tick" marks at fifteen minute intervals. By default, if you press the Advance button, it will skip forward to the next tick mark. I rarely see how that is useful. 
"\nBy activating the easter egg, it changes the function of the advance button from next tick mark to a 30-second skip forward button. If you overshoot, you can just back up by clicking on the Instant Replay button. Some people just fast-forward through the commercials, and when you press Play, the Tivo will automaticaaly back up a few seconds. It's personal preference. After all, it's not videotape."
\nThe skip-to-tick mark function is still there with the easter egg activated. Just press FF, then advance.
\nI have found only one bug with the 30-second skip. If you are at the end of a recording and press the 30-second skip, it skips back to the beginning of the program.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\nOnce it is set to 30 second skip (worked for me), is there a way to re-set it to the factory setting again?\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYes, the same way that you activated it. It is a toggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t

ctually its not the same thing.  ReplayTv has always had a 30 second skip button.  The 4x00 series also had a commercial skip feature that would detect commercials and skip over all of them.  So if there were 6 commercials then the ReplayTv would skip over all of them without you having to press any buttons.\n\t\t\t\t\t

emember if your Tivo restart(Software update, loss of power ect.) It will go back to default(skip to next tick mark) In fact all the hidden things you turned on will go back to default.

"Back" needs to be brought back. It\'s annoying having to exit and renter the apps just to go somewhere else.

I was worried initially because i wasn\'t able to map a "D" button. \xc2\xa0So Channel up will skip commercials forward, and channel down will skip back.\n
\n\tWhat other features am I missing from the new driver by using the old driver?\n
"\n\tYou don't have the power management option that exists in the newer driver. \xc2\xa0\n"
\n\tThe older driver works fine with the Bolt.\n
"\n\tExactly which 'back' command are we talking about? \xc2\xa0This is the protocol document we're using, and I can't find a 'Back' button in there anywhere...\n"
\n\tThe driver lets you remap nearly every normally remappable key on the Control4 remote to any command in the document, and it would be trivial to add Back if it existed in the protocol.\n
"\n\tI'd *love* to add 'Back' to the current driver, if it's missing something I can add, but I'm not seeing it.\n"
\n\t"Back" is on the Bolt and keyboard remotes on the left side under Input, in the same location "Zoom" used to be (though the new remotes have a dedicated Zoom key on the right).\n
"\n\tIt's not documented, but maybe IRCODE BACK would work?\n"
\n\tBack might be EXIT. \xc2\xa0Not sure if EXIT, IRCODE EXIT or KEYBOARD EXIT\n
\n\tDont know if you support Zoom, but the command for that is WINDOW\n
\n\tIn case anyone is interested the "D" skip function introduced on the Bolt has now been rolled out nationwide to Roamio users.\n
"\n\tthe left arrow, works as a back button .. Yes the old driver did have a back button...I never used it! Just left arrow to go back in the menus'.. IF you don't like the new driver use the old one or make your own.. this is just repetitive, for days\n"

\n\tOr,\xc2\xa0they can correct the driver by\xc2\xa0adding the back button.\n
\n Dont know if you support Zoom, but the command for that is WINDOW
"\n\tNot sure what you're asking, but the button on the (newer) remotes is labeled Zoom\n"
"\n Not sure what you're asking, but the button on the (newer) remotes is labeled Zoom"
\nSo the missing back button is labeled zoom on the peanut remote. 
\nZoom is mapped to * or # on the SR2n0

\n\t\t\tZoom is mapped to * or # on the SR2n0\n\t\t
\n\tNo. \xc2\xa0Zoom has nothing to do with Back. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n
\n No. \xc2\xa0Zoom has nothing to do with Back. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\nOk but this thread is about the missing back button in the driver. 
\nNot sure how zoom. Zoomed in. Mazda product placement perhaps?
\nSo which button on the peanut remote is the missing back button?
\n\t\t\tOk but this thread is about the missing back button in the driver.\n\t\t

\n\t\t\tSo which button on the peanut remote is the missing back button?\n\t\t
\n\tThis back button is not mapped on the new driver. This button is very much needed in streaming apps like VUDU, HuLu, Plex and other streaming apps.\n
\n\tIs the back different than the exit command? \xc2\xa0The exit command by default is mapped to the # button in the Roamio driver.\n

ew TiVo DVR will skip through entire commercial break, speed up playback to save time
ew TiVo DVR will skip through entire commercial break, speed up playback to save time
W YORK, N.Y. \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That\xe2\x80\x99s quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours.
atellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompting lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish\xe2\x80\x99s lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish\xe2\x80\x99s commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station.
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice-President Jim Denney.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not changing the underlying content,\xe2\x80\x9d Denney said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\xe2\x80\x99re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d
he TiVo Bolt also has a \xe2\x80\x9cquick mode\xe2\x80\x9d that plays back recordings 30 per cent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\xe2\x80\x99t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for \xe2\x80\x9cHow I Met Your Mother\xe2\x80\x9d for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
he TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device\xe2\x80\x99s full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away.
Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement comes a day after Google Inc. began selling upgrades to its $35 Chromecast video-streaming device. It also launched a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service. A few weeks ago, Amazon.com Inc. refreshed its streaming-TV devices. The new Fire TV, selling for $100 and shipping next week, will also support 4K video streaming. Apple Inc. is also coming out with an Apple TV update in October.

iVo Loath to Admit Ad Skip Trick
"that skipping commercials is one of the attractive features of a personal video recorder like TiVo or Sonicblue's ReplayTV."
"Sonicblue heavily promotes a feature in ReplayTV that completely skips over ads at the touch of a button. That's at least one reason a slew of media companies, including AOL Time Warner and Disney, is suing the company."
iVo users can fast-forward through ads on recorded programs. But an undocumented feature \xe2\x80\x93 well-known to the TiVo community \xe2\x80\x93 is a 5-button code that, when activated, makes clicking through a string of ads easier by advancing programming in 30-second intervals with each button click.
he magic combination circulated on weblogs recently and was likely first posted on the 
"While not a new trick, it's one customers like and talk about. Company officials, on the other hand, seem reluctant to discuss it."
"It\'s not an official feature of the service," said Bob Poniatowski, product marketing manager for TiVo. "We don\'t promote it."
Poniatowski said "hackers" figured out the button combination that activates the 30-second skip, which TiVo programmers developed for internal use. "We have more important things to do as a company than stay ahead of these guys," he said.
"It\'s pretty simple," said Aditya Kishore, an analyst with the 
. "They don\'t want to be sued.
"They don\'t want to take on the media establishment," he said.
Marvin Plettner, an unemployed software engineer from Alameda, California, posted on his website 
Plettner emphasized that he did not discover the combination on his own. He posted the directions as a reminder to himself and others.
"I\'d be really disappointed if, for whatever reason, they took away this feature," he said.
"Joe Sacher, a computer consultant and programmer from Indianapolis speculated that in addition to avoiding legal troubles, TiVo doesn't promote the 30-second skip because it would confuse the mainstream consumer."
"They want to keep it simplified for the average user that just wants to bring the unit home, plug it in and use it," Sacher said. "They would get more support calls if they had these functionalities listed in their manual."
acher said he experimented with the 30-second skip but turned it off because he occasionally likes to watch commercials for new movies or television programs. Instead, he has programmed in an add-on feature that automatically sorts recorded shows by program title.
"The Yankee Group's Kishore said it's in TiVo's best interest not to ruffle the feathers of content providers."
He said that when it first launched, the company expected the TiVo units to sell quickly, which has not happened.
"The idea was to make the box as valuable as possible to the consumer and not really worry about the existing television programmers," Kishore said. "As they went on I think they realized that the box was not going to sell as fast as they originally envisioned. That changes the game substantially.
"They don\'t have a whole lot to bargain with, and they need to play nice with the more powerful players."
"They\'re much more in workings with media companies than Replay," Sacher said. "A lot of these business decisions may be driven by not biting the hand that feeds them."
"With or without these secret features, people say they can't live without their TiVos."
"It\'s one of those \'you can pry it from my cold, dead hands\' kind of things," Sacher said.

If you are not yet familiar with kmttg AutoSkip, refer to the 
his Wiki describes kmttg functionality used to automatically obtain commercial cut points based on TiVo SkipMode data. This will only work for series 5 or later TiVos that support TiVo SkipMode functionality.
If you are not familiar with AutoSkip a quick way to try it out is select an NPL table entry that has SKIP icon indicated, press "v" to have kmttg compute skip points and wait until table entry has an "S" indicated in front of SKIP icon. Then press "z" to start playing the show on your TiVo and enjoy hands free auto commercial skipping while watching the show.
here are a few NPL table right mouse button menu entries associated with AutoSkip when enabled in kmttg
his command operates on 1 or more selected entries in NPL table.
he goal of this command is to automatically obtain commercial cut points based on TiVo SkipMode data.
his will only work if the SKIP icon is shown for the NPL entries you are running it on, indicating that TiVo SkipMode data exists for the shows.
"IMPORTANT: This command will simulate various remote button presses to your TiVo to obtain show segment start points, and thus should not be run if you don't want to disrupt anybody currently watching that TiVo."
how segment start points are discovered by skipping to end of show, then using repeated "Channel Down" presses to cycle through all SkipMode show segment start points.
"The problem is that doesn't give us the show segment end points (start of commercials). Commercial start points cannot be obtained from the TiVo by pressing D or channel up/down. So those are computed based on assumption that the length of each show segment should be very similar even when recorded on different TiVos, so TiVo SkipMode data is used to compute the length of each segment and that information used to estimate segment end points."
hat assumption typically yields a pretty good set of cut points that are not too far off, usually about 2-4 seconds late (i.e. a couple of seconds into start of commercials).      
Once cut points are computed kmttg automatically adds an AutoSkip entry to kmttg AutoSkip table.
Once an AutoSkip table entry exists (indicated by S in NPL table) you can choose 
"AutoSkip from SkipMode - ALL" (bindkey w)
"This will search through whole NPL table looking for entries containing SkipMode data and that don't already have AutoSkip entries."
If any eligible entries found then you are prompted to confirm it\'s OK to run "AutoSkip from SkipMode" function on all of the entries in succession.
"AutoSkip from SkipMode task can be automated by scheduling to run kmttg in batch mode on your OS at times of your choosing that won't interfere with viewing on your TiVo(s). For more information and examples of that on Windows OS consult the "
his command operates on 1 or more selected entries in NPL table.
Will export cuts to VideoRedo project file if VideoRedo is enable, else will export cuts to edl file.
For VideoRedo project file creation, .mpg or .ts file will be used as reference video file if either exists, else .TiVo file will be used whether or not it exists.
his command operates on 1st selected entry in NPL table.
For table entries that have AutoSkip data available (indicated with S in 1st column of NPL table) this will start playback of the show on your TiVo in AutoSkip mode for hands free automatic commercial skipping. (You must leave kmttg running for the duration of the show to get auto skipping).

"That gives me an option of using something like Tivo's Bolt+, or going completely off cable for something like Layer3TV."
"Curious if anyone's tried either.\xc2\xa0 If it were just me I'd cut the cord in terms of TV but that's not really an option here."

I was appalled at Layer 3\'s price when they called me back 2 weeks\xc2\xa0after my online inquiry\xc2\xa0- one of those "professional marketing teen" type girls who clearly was taking her job too seriously even had the gall to ask why I wouldn\'t just sign up\xc2\xa0today, to\xc2\xa0try it out, for a WHOLE\xc2\xa0year!\xc2\xa0 I laughed her off the phone when she tried to spin it as a "premium experience"\xc2\xa0...like I\'m some kind of C-level with 2 summer houses a yacht and a helicopter ...that\'s who Level 3 is for.\xc2\xa0 By the way, you STILL have to pay for Comcast Internet (or whoever)\xc2\xa0just to get Level 3.\xc2\xa0 I predict this is\xc2\xa0another dot-com company that will waste investors $$ on catered lunches for the office, perhaps even get sold a few times, before anyone realizes what a bad idea it was.
Uh, YouTubeTV is out, Amazon Fire TV is awesome, Pluto.TV is great, Simple.TV is fine for local channels - how much TV does one person really need to watch?\xc2\xa0 Maybe the cost savings is in canceling Comcast and just watching less.
"Comcast Internet with Layer 3 is cheaper than my Comcast bundle.\xc2\xa0 :)\xc2\xa0 My issue is their competitor's faster connection isn't available with their whole home DVR solution.\xc2\xa0 It probably will be down the road, but I don't want to speculate on when that will happen.\xc2\xa0 So I either take a hit on Internet, or I come up with a different solution.\xc2\xa0 As far as your question about how much TV, my wife has a lot of shows on her list."
\nTiVo is great. I ended up going for the Bolt instead of the Bolt+ because I felt like four tuners and 1TB storage was enough with only three of us in the house (Bolt+ has six tuners and 3TB of storage). I also got some TiVo Mini Extenders for bedrooms. 
"Bolt has two new features over older versions. There is a one-button commercial skip that I didn't think would be a big deal when reading about it, but it's handy.  The best feature is QuickMode, which plays 30% faster while modulating audio so it doesn't sound like chipmunks. It's really nice for watching sports and generic dramas (I don't use it for anything with singing or where comedic timing is important). \n\n"
I wish every tech demo/training video out there had the 30% speedup option.\xc2\xa0 Half the time I feel like I\'m Prince Humperdink at the wedding saying "skip to the end"...\xc2\xa0 "MAN AND WIFE, SAY MAN AND WIFE".
Level3 not available in my area, but it looks awesome.\xc2\xa0
For now, Plex Channels will have to suffice.\xc2\xa0
"Bummer, was hoping to get more feedback on this topic.\xc2\xa0 Looks like it's going to be Tivo if i switch.\xc2\xa0 Of course ideally Comcast says oh you're leaving, we can do a promo.. Not holding my breath."

\n      TiVo Bolt review: Watching TV faster\n    
kip commercials with one click, and speed up the rest of the show, too
Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo has no commercial-skipping button\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\'t make good business sense."
It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.
nd the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. \xe2\x80\x9cSkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant,\xe2\x80\x9d TiVo now boasts.
, a new weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and  Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.
Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.
In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.
nd that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.
he latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock".
till, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.
he Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.
Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 Gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.
But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit Ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)
Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.
iVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.
o make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."
"One of the most important features of the Bolt isn't new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku."
For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.
ow, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".
ot only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.
In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.
nd, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.
In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.
Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.
lso, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.
While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.
I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.
But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.
ure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.

"I am looking to archive recordings for three networked Tivo's (Premiere, Premiere XL4 and Bolt 1000). Which ReadyNAS would you recommend? Does the software archive changes (additions/deletions) to the recordings, or does a complete overwrite of all the recordings?"
he Tivo Archiving function in ReadyNas uses the same solution as the discontinued Tivo Desktop software. \xc2\xa0It has not been updated in years and is ENTIRELY lacking. \xc2\xa0It does not sync recordings, it simply archives them from your Tivo and recovers them to the Tivo. \xc2\xa0There are several major downsides to archiving the shows from your Tivo
1) You lose closed captions from the recording
2) As a by-product of losing the closed captions you lose the new Tivo commercial skip functionality
2) You lose metadata from the recording - so much of the shows description is lost
I have found the best solution for archiving a Tivo is to drop a 8TB disk in your newest Tivo (for you the bolt via eSATA) and use the Tivo itself as the NAS. \xc2\xa0You can share shows between your Tivos and have enough storage to last several seasons. \xc2\xa0You will have to use a program called MFS reformatter to set up the hard drive. \xc2\xa0You can find this on the TiVoCommunity forum.
nother option is to use one of the archiving programs like KMTTG or Archivo. \xc2\xa0But that is more of a hands on experience vs automated.
With WD 8TB Red internal drives available from Best Buy for $170 (via shucking the WD easystore), I think the Tivo as a NAS is currently the best archiving solution you can create.
I need to revise my question. I am trying to backup my recordings so that when my Tivo crashes I do not completely lose my recordings. I have had many die over the years, and my Bolt was 5 months old when it bit the dust. I can live with the loss of close captions, metadata and commercial-skip.
o you have a recommendation for this?
If all you want to do is archive the Tivo recordings and you definitely want a NAS, then the least expensive ReadyNAS will do. \xc2\xa0I purchased the RN102 for $80 on sale at New Egg a while back. \xc2\xa0You can put 2 WD Red drives in there for $100 or max it out for $340 as described above. \xc2\xa0That will give you all you need to enable the ReadyNAS Tivo archive function. \xc2\xa0
Having used the ReadyNAS Tivo archive function for a year, I would rather use a PC and one of the freely available programs on Tivo Community forums. \xc2\xa0The ReadyNAS solution is not perfect, but if you want a NAS for other things as well then maybe it makes some sense to go that route.
IT: \xc2\xa0Just thought of this as well. \xc2\xa0Some of the Netgear Routers support Tivo Archiving. \xc2\xa0You plug an external hard drive into the router and can back up your recordings in the same manner as the readyNas. \xc2\xa0Just another option

he Secret Method to Skip Commercials with One Button on Your DV
10/03/13
"DVRs have made all our lives better, that's a verifiable fact. But fast forwarding through our DVRs is an inexact science, sometimes we skip too far and have to slowly rewind with awkward button combinations. Other times we're too fearful of faster forwarding that we cut it off with too much left to go. No worries. Lifehacker put together a list of ways to create a secret automatic commercial-skipping button on your DVR. Clean."
How to Enable a Hidden Commercial-Skipping Button on Any DV
10/03/13
epending on where you get your DVR, it may or may not have the ability to skip commercials. The best ones have a button that lets you jump forward, but if your DVR was issued by a cable or satellite company, they may have hidden or removed it. Here are some semi-secret ways to do it anyway.
", and we decided to take another look to see if those DVR tweaks and tricks still work. Here's what we found:"
30-Second DVR Tweak Speeds Up Commercial Skipping
VRs have revolutionized the way people watch TV, but if you&apos;ve always wished your DVR were a\xe2\x80\xa6
"If you have a newer Motorola DVR, you can easily program a 30-second skip button that works both on pre-recorded shows and while you're in Cable mode and watching certain live TV events. Here's how to do it, thanks to "
". If you've done it correctly, AUX will blink twice again."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do, the "
"Matt notes that the new 30-second skip button will work in Cable mode as well as for pre-recorded programming. He also notes that if your AUX button was set up to control a receiver or some other device in your entertainment system, you'll need to reprogram it after doing this."
"This method should work for most newer Comcast-issued DVRs, but if you still have one of the older ones with the silver remotes, our old trick should still work. Here's how to do it, if you need a refresher:"
". If you've done it correctly, CABLE will blink twice."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do,the "
"That's all there is to it. Reportedly this works even on Comcast's newest DVR models."
If you have a DirecTV DVR (model HR2X) and remote, your remote may already have a "slip" button on it that will essentially fast forward for 30 seconds. It\'s not the same as actually skipping 30 seconds ahead in one tap, but it probably covers more time. Still, you can customize the behavior of that button so it\'s a "skip" and not a "slip" if you prefer. 
, this is how you do it
Press the red button on your remote. Make sure the 
You may see a message that says "There are no matching programs." That\'s okay.
"Now, the fast forward button will skip forward 30 seconds every time you tap it. Tap the button four or five times when a commercial break starts, and you should be clear of all of the commercials in pretty short order. If you don't like the change and want to undo it, just follow the steps above and use the code "
, and it should go back to normal.
", and point out that it also works on DirecTV HR20-700s, as well as the newer HR2X models, as long as they've been updated recently."
Of course, Dish Network is the home of 
", a new DVR that's specifically designed to make skipping commercials easy, no matter what TV or device you're watching on. The Hopper is the first device to include Dish's new "
", which will alert you ahead of time that it's capable of skipping over commercial breaks in selected programming, and then just do it automatically without you having to lift a finger."
"If you'd rather have control (or you run into programming where Auto Hop doesn't work), you can still skip content yourself\xe2\x80\x94there's likely a 30-second skip button already on your remote. Even if you have an older Dish Network DVR, you probably have a skip button that works for both pre-recorded programming and that works if you've paused live TV, and want to skip any commercials or filler that aired after you hit the pause button."
FIOS TV DVRs also don\'t have a specific "commercial skip" feature, but they do have a built-in 30-second skip and fully-featured fast forward, both of which work on pre-recorded programming and after pausing live TV, but not on Video On Demand programming. However, in some cases if you\'re using FIOS TV\'s multi-room DVR feature and watching recorded programming on a non-DVR box elsewhere in your home, 
". The fast forward button, however, does work wherever you're watching."
iVo won\'t skip commercials specifically, but you can change your skip button into a 30-second skip instead of a "skip to the next part of the show." Our 
"While playing a recorded show, hit select-play-select-3-0-select. You'll hear 3 chimes if you did it right. You'll need to redo this whenever the Tivo reboots."
ow, your "skip" button will skip 30 seconds, not to the next hash mark on your show\'s progress bar. 
Wired reports that this still works too
", and confirms that if your TiVo loses power, gets a software update, or is rebooted, you'll have to repeat the above command to get the 30-second skip functionality back. The skip feature does not work on live TV."
"With luck, there's a skip button or feature for your DVR in the list above, or it already comes with a button that allows you to quickly fast forward or skip 30 seconds at a time without hassle. However, you'll notice we didn't mention some providers, most notably Time Warner, who actually "
going out of their way to stop you from skipping commercials
". To their defense, they say it's because content owners are making them do it, and "
". Regardless of who's to blame, if we couldn't find a method that worked universally for a cable or satellite provider, we didn't include them."
Of course, if you really want full and total control over your pre-recorded programming, your best bet is to either buy your own DVR independent of your TV provider, or 
build one yourself and record your own shows
". Then you're the one in the driver's seat, and you can skip whatever you like."

iVo DVR offers option to skip entire commercial break
Updated on September 30, 2015 at  1:31 PM
Posted on September 30, 2015 at  1:27 PM
\n        \n            This product image provided by TiVo shows the new TiVo Bolt digital video recorder. With one press of a button, the Bolt will skip an entire commercial break when users watch recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours.\n        \n        \n            \n                
W YORK -- TiVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings."
he feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours.
"Satellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompted lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish's commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station."
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney.
"We\'re not changing the underlying content," Denney said in an interview. "We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly."
he TiVo Bolt also has a "quick mode" that plays back recordings 30 percent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\'t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for "How I Met Your Mother" for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
"The TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device's full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo's starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away."
"Wednesday's announcement comes a day after Google Inc. began selling upgrades to its $35 Chromecast video-streaming device. It also launched a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service."
 few weeks ago, Amazon.com Inc. refreshed its streaming-TV devices. The new Fire TV, selling for $100 and shipping next week, will also support 4K video streaming. Apple Inc. is also coming out with an Apple TV update in October.

he first Bolt ad to focus entirely on the advanced ad-zapping functionality was a 15-second spot that aired in the third quarter of NFL Network\'s telecast of the Nov. 12 Bills-Jets game. Running a few weeks after TiVo first rolled out its new entertainment platform, the "Here Come the Commercials" spot was seen by approximately 8 million viewers. The ad, which features a couple engaging in commercial interruptus, closes with a wholly unambiguous tag line: "The all-new TiVo Bolt. Skip entire commercials with a press of a button."
"Here Come the Commercials" popped up one last time before going inactive, appearing in the second quarter of NFL Net\'s Dec. 10 Vikings-Cardinals telecast.

 second ad that explicitly sings the praises of ad avoidance aired just once before it too disappeared. The 30-second 
"Premature Playage" is more or less the Platonic Ideal of overwrought marketing, trotting out a faux physician, wailing infant, emasculating wife, surly goth teen and a debilitating shot to the groin of the paterfamilias in the space of its brief run. The upshot of this ad is that people who try to fast-forward through commercial pods with their traditional DVRs tend to overshoot the last spot, thereby impinging on the programming they actually want to watch. The phony doc\'s prescription? Skip the pods seamlessly with TiVo Bolt.
"Oddly enough, TiVo's exhortation to surgically excise TV ads is nowhere to be found in its extant Bolt spot, which is titled "
 TiVo representative did not respond to a request for comment.
ccording to iSpot.tv estimates, "It Eats Commercials" is doing all the heavy lifting for TiVo, having aired 229 times since it bowed back on Oct. 5. The company has shelled out around $870,000 for all that inventory, although the dollars appear to be drying up; per iSpot, the last paid-for airing was on Dec. 17, during the Rockets-Lakers game on TNT.
ven without any overt nods to commercial avoidance, the networks haven\'t exactly fallen all over themselves in their haste to air the "It Eats Commercials" spot. In the three months it has been in circulation, the TiVo ad has appeared only on TNT, Pac-12 Network and NBA TV. "It Eats Commercials" has aired exclusively in live NBA games and shoulder programming, as well as in Pac-12 college football telecasts.
"While most ad-supported networks are likely to steer clear of future Bolt spots, the brand's sports-heavy TV buy also makes a good deal of sense. For one thing, the fact that sports are almost exclusively watched live eliminates much of the ad avoidance that plagues time-shifted programming."
"But with Bolt, as it happens, sports is bulletproof. Tivo's new skip function doesn't work on pre-recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
he limitations of the device are not inconsiderable. At present, skip mode is available for shows recorded from just 20 network feeds, a roster that includes the Big Five broadcasters as well as cable heavyweights like 
", TBS, TNT and USA Network. TiVo's new skip function also doesn't work on recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
\'s "Squawk Box," outgoing TiVo CEO Tom Rogers denied that Bolt was a commercial killer, even though it is (stealthily) being marketed as such. "We know, with DVR behavior, people still watch a lot of commercials even though they have the ability to fast-forward," he said. "We know, even with this, they\'ll still get a lot of commercials coming through."
"That the networks haven't gone on the offensive against Bolt may well be a function of the company's relatively limited impact on the overall TV ecosystem. Per its most recent 10-Q filing with the FCC, TiVo reported that it serves 6.47 million subscribers, a tally that includes 952,000 customers who own their own units and 5.52 million who rent a box from their cable operator. And while that marks a 26% increase from the year-ago period, TiVo's sub base represents just 6% of the 116.4 million U.S. TV households."
Broadcasters were far more proactive four years ago, after 
ish this week unveiled the Hopper 3 at CES.
If it seems counterintuitive for ad-supportive networks to allow disruptive technologies to promote their wares on their air, executives say that money often trumps ideology. "Retweets are not endorsements, and neither is my decision to take money from someone who may or may not be trying to put me out of business," cracked one senior ad sales exec. "We let Netflix advertise all the time, and if you listen to Reed Hastings, they\'re going to kill us all in the next five years."

VR viewers skip commercials, hurt advertisers\xe2\x80\x99 feelings
"It's a sign o' the times: marketing firms are complaining about timeshifted TV \xe2\x80\xa6"
t the heart of the advertisers\' argument is the much-reported propensity for DVR users to fast-forward through commercials. Some users are said to have shifted their entire TV viewing habits to best avoid exposure to ads. If they want to see something live, they prefer to start watching half an hour late, just to be able to skip commercial breaks. "
It\'s a terrifying statistic for advertisers and networks because, "The thing that scares us most is that they say, \'When we get TiVo, we\'re going to skip commercials,\'" said Kristi Argyilan, executive vice president of channel insight at Arnold, a Boston ad agency. And Pam McNeely, group media director at Dailey & Associates Advertising (IPG ), figures the number of installed DVRs could go to 40 percent by the end of 2007. "You tell that to clients," she says, "and they say, \'Oh, my God! I\'m cutting TV spending.\'"
"In response, TV executives have gone so far as to threaten to lock out advertisers who insist on lower fees because of the DVR factor. They say that the argument is invalid, because DVRs also drive a larger audience to the TV set now that the customer isn't chained to a time slot or cumbersome video tapes anymore. That should be worth every penny of the ad fees, in the networks' opinion. ABC's sales president Mike Shaw has said he wouldn't even negotiate with clients who want to exclude timeshifted viewing from their rate calculations. "
"Another criticism that both sides seem to agree on is the questionable value of Nielsen's numbers. DVR users are underrepresented by about half in the current sample population, throwing the validity of timeshifted data into question. In response, Nielsen is now actively recruiting new DVR families, adding at least 20 percent to the number of families with such technology available per month. At that rate, they will multiply their DVR sample by 9 in a year's time, and nobody is expecting the growth of actual users to keep that kind of pace. "
If you\'re wondering how Nielsen gets the numbers, the answer is "multiple sources" in this case. The People Meter set-top boxes that report viewing information down to the data center in Florida can communicate directly with TiVo boxes, and for unsupported brands, the audio watermarking signal attached to every broadcast tells the Nielsen equipment exactly what\'s being viewed and when it was originally aired. It\'s a far cry from the simple handwritten journals of old, and the increased accuracy of the new measurement methods\xe2\x80\x94with or without timeshifting\xe2\x80\x94also seems to scare the company\'s customers. But that\'s a story for another rainy day. For now, just walk away with another indication that the television industry fears change of all kinds.
In reponse to the rise of commercial-skipping media centers, advertisers are leaning ever more heavily on the

iVo finally tells TV broadcasters to stuff it
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
lmost from its inception, TiVo, the San Jose company whose device has given the generic name to\xc2\xa0digital video recorders, has had an uneasy relationship with the broadcasting industry. But with the release last week of a new model of TiVo recorder dubbed the Bolt, the firm is encouraging customers to 
\xc2\xa0in its indelicate words. This is a big change from the past.\xc2\xa0
"A quick look at the history of TiVo. By\xc2\xa0allowing viewers to fast-forward through commercials (not to mention the dull stretches of\xc2\xa0TV programs), devices like TiVo's threatened the very principle of advertising-supported TV."
"TiVo and its original competitor, ReplayTV--both introduced their products in 1999--took different approaches to this option. Through a button on the Replay remote, you could skip commercials entirely, 30 seconds\xc2\xa0at a time. Broadcasters hated that. TiVo took a kinder, gentler approach: You could fast-forward, but not skip. That meant that you would still be exposed to the commercials, albeit\xc2\xa0at turbo-speed. That mollified broadcasters and advertisers somewhat, and it fed into the company's strategy of reaching lucrative cooperative agreements with the networks.\xc2\xa0"
It was a combination of accepting reality (fast-forward was a functionality that\xc2\xa0TiVo buyers demanded) and leaving broadcasters with at least a crumb of outreach to viewers. It may not have detracted much from the DVR experience, which was as compelling as a thunderclap.
\xc2\xa0that during all the years when\xc2\xa0high-tech entrepreneurs would march\xc2\xa0through The Times offices showing off their innovative products, only once did I ever see one that made me think, "This will change my life." It was the\xc2\xa0ReplayTV box, and its potential for completely changing the TV viewing experience was instantly apparent.
"There just aren't enough of you to sustain the company's retail business alone."
\xe2\x80\x94 TiVo executive Ira Bahr to a forum of TiVo enthusiasts
"TiVo's strategy of cozying up to broadcasters, which included offering promotional space on the TiVo box to be pushed at users, enabled the firm to outlast ReplayTV, which\xc2\xa0finally disappeared after several ownership changes.\xc2\xa0But it hasn't yielded consistent profitability--TiVo didn't report\xc2\xa0its first annual profit until 2009, and it has lost money\xc2\xa0in six\xc2\xa0of its last 10\xc2\xa0fiscal years."
"So here comes the Bolt. The serpentine-shaped unit, which will sell for up to $400 with a one-year programming subscription included, offers two new features. One is Skip Mode, a return to the ReplayTV past, which allows users to skip entire commercial breaks at the press of a button. The other is Quick Mode, which allows playback of recorded shows 30% faster, with the audio electronically tweaked so the actors don't all sound like quacking ducks. (Broadcasters might\xc2\xa0not care about that, though content producers might hate it.)"
"Skip Mode is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that the heyday of interpolated broadcast TV commercials is over. It's also a sign of TiVo's new strategy, which\xc2\xa0is to appeal to cord-cutting viewers who get more of their video from subscription sources without commercials, such as Netflix, HBO Now\xc2\xa0and Amazon Prime. Even so, "
\xc2\xa0only for shows on the most popular\xc2\xa020 networks or so, and for shows airing between 4 p.m. and midnight.
"The Bolt itself is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that TiVo's overall business model--selling full-featured DVRs for up to $600 and charging annual subscription fees of $150--is tapped out. Subscriptions are stagnating, and the set-top boxes rented to customers by cable and satellite systems typically incorporate their own DVRs."
iVo added 150,000 subscriptions last year, its chief marketing officer, Ira Bahr, told 
an online forum of loyal TiVo customers
\xc2\xa0last week. "There just aren\'t enough of you to sustain the company\xe2\x80\x99s retail business alone," he said. "Compare that to the millions of streamers out there, and the tens of millions of DVRs out there,\xc2\xa0and you see that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of ground to make up."\xc2\xa0
Whether TiVo will survive the continued evolution of TV is anyone\'s guess. It was successful at upending the business model of broadcasting and cable, but it hasn\'t been the victor in the free-for-all that followed. It\'s still fighting for its life--if it can\'t expand its market, Bahr said, "we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to do much of anything."
s streaming video takes over, the DVR record-at-home model may vanish, too; the box streaming your\xc2\xa0Netflix or Amazon Prime choices\xc2\xa0has no moving parts to break down, and of course no commercials to skip.

How to Enable a Hidden Commercial-Skipping Button on Any DV
10/03/13
epending on where you get your DVR, it may or may not have the ability to skip commercials. The best ones have a button that lets you jump forward, but if your DVR was issued by a cable or satellite company, they may have hidden or removed it. Here are some semi-secret ways to do it anyway.
", and we decided to take another look to see if those DVR tweaks and tricks still work. Here's what we found:"
30-Second DVR Tweak Speeds Up Commercial Skipping
VRs have revolutionized the way people watch TV, but if you&apos;ve always wished your DVR were a\xe2\x80\xa6
"If you have a newer Motorola DVR, you can easily program a 30-second skip button that works both on pre-recorded shows and while you're in Cable mode and watching certain live TV events. Here's how to do it, thanks to "
". If you've done it correctly, AUX will blink twice again."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do, the "
"Matt notes that the new 30-second skip button will work in Cable mode as well as for pre-recorded programming. He also notes that if your AUX button was set up to control a receiver or some other device in your entertainment system, you'll need to reprogram it after doing this."
"This method should work for most newer Comcast-issued DVRs, but if you still have one of the older ones with the silver remotes, our old trick should still work. Here's how to do it, if you need a refresher:"
". If you've done it correctly, CABLE will blink twice."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do,the "
"That's all there is to it. Reportedly this works even on Comcast's newest DVR models."
If you have a DirecTV DVR (model HR2X) and remote, your remote may already have a "slip" button on it that will essentially fast forward for 30 seconds. It\'s not the same as actually skipping 30 seconds ahead in one tap, but it probably covers more time. Still, you can customize the behavior of that button so it\'s a "skip" and not a "slip" if you prefer. 
, this is how you do it
Press the red button on your remote. Make sure the 
You may see a message that says "There are no matching programs." That\'s okay.
"Now, the fast forward button will skip forward 30 seconds every time you tap it. Tap the button four or five times when a commercial break starts, and you should be clear of all of the commercials in pretty short order. If you don't like the change and want to undo it, just follow the steps above and use the code "
, and it should go back to normal.
", and point out that it also works on DirecTV HR20-700s, as well as the newer HR2X models, as long as they've been updated recently."
Of course, Dish Network is the home of 
", a new DVR that's specifically designed to make skipping commercials easy, no matter what TV or device you're watching on. The Hopper is the first device to include Dish's new "
", which will alert you ahead of time that it's capable of skipping over commercial breaks in selected programming, and then just do it automatically without you having to lift a finger."
"If you'd rather have control (or you run into programming where Auto Hop doesn't work), you can still skip content yourself\xe2\x80\x94there's likely a 30-second skip button already on your remote. Even if you have an older Dish Network DVR, you probably have a skip button that works for both pre-recorded programming and that works if you've paused live TV, and want to skip any commercials or filler that aired after you hit the pause button."
FIOS TV DVRs also don\'t have a specific "commercial skip" feature, but they do have a built-in 30-second skip and fully-featured fast forward, both of which work on pre-recorded programming and after pausing live TV, but not on Video On Demand programming. However, in some cases if you\'re using FIOS TV\'s multi-room DVR feature and watching recorded programming on a non-DVR box elsewhere in your home, 
". The fast forward button, however, does work wherever you're watching."
iVo won\'t skip commercials specifically, but you can change your skip button into a 30-second skip instead of a "skip to the next part of the show." Our 
"While playing a recorded show, hit select-play-select-3-0-select. You'll hear 3 chimes if you did it right. You'll need to redo this whenever the Tivo reboots."
ow, your "skip" button will skip 30 seconds, not to the next hash mark on your show\'s progress bar. 
Wired reports that this still works too
", and confirms that if your TiVo loses power, gets a software update, or is rebooted, you'll have to repeat the above command to get the 30-second skip functionality back. The skip feature does not work on live TV."
"With luck, there's a skip button or feature for your DVR in the list above, or it already comes with a button that allows you to quickly fast forward or skip 30 seconds at a time without hassle. However, you'll notice we didn't mention some providers, most notably Time Warner, who actually "
going out of their way to stop you from skipping commercials
". To their defense, they say it's because content owners are making them do it, and "
". Regardless of who's to blame, if we couldn't find a method that worked universally for a cable or satellite provider, we didn't include them."
Of course, if you really want full and total control over your pre-recorded programming, your best bet is to either buy your own DVR independent of your TV provider, or 
build one yourself and record your own shows
". Then you're the one in the driver's seat, and you can skip whatever you like."

ish Agrees To Cripple Its Ad-Skipping DVR To Settle Fox Lawsuit
"\nFor years now, broadcasters have waged legal war on Dish network for giving consumers what they want: namely a DVR that automatically skips advertisements users weren't watching anyway. Fox, CBS and NBC Universal all sued Dish "
, claiming that the ad-skipping technology embedded in its "Hopper" DVR violated copyright. Most of the lawsuits were packed with hilariously baseless claims, like Fox ignoring the Betamax case to breathlessly insist that 
merely recording the entire prime time lineup
", with Dish agreeing to hamstring Hopper's skipping functionality in exchange for not only an end to legal hostilities, but access to streaming video rights for its Sling TV service. Fox however continued to push its luck in the courts with "
\nWith the arrival of 2016, however, comes word that Dish and Fox have 
". According to the companies' statement, Dish has, as it did with CBS and Disney, agreed to further cripple its DVR's ad-skipping functionality:"
"Fox Networks Group and Dish Network L.L.C. have reached an agreement resulting in the dismissal of all pending litigation between the two companies, including disputes over Slingbox technology and the AutoHop, PrimeTime Anytime and Transfers features,\xe2\x80\x9d Dish said in the statement. 
"As part of the settlement, Dish\xe2\x80\x99s AutoHop commercial-skipping functionality will not be available for owned and affiliated Fox stations until seven days after a program first airs.\xe2\x80\x9d
"Though it's not indicated by the companies' announcement, the settlement likely also involves some broader access to Fox content for use in Dish's Sling TV service, so the deal's probably not a total evolutionary wash. Still, the end result is one of the most popular and innovative DVRs on the market being crippled just to make legacy broadcast executives feel more comfortable as their empires face earth-shaking disruption on every front.\n"
\nWith the exception of Comcast NBC Universal (which, not coincidentally, directly competes with Dish as a cable provider), all of the original 2012 lawsuits have now been put to bed -- but at the cost of innovation and customer satisfaction.

s a result of the settlement, my household will now defer viewing content from owned and affiliated Fox stations until at least eight days after a program first airs. For the sake of advertisers I do not skip (rare, but happens), they had better be using time-insensitive ads.
12:12pm
"I already refuse to watch anything that (at the very least) hasn't been pause long enough to skip commercials. I guess now anything Fox related will be pushed back by 7+ days."
"Or, I guess I can find something to watch that's not all trashed with annoying crap."
o those who will respond with "but, but, the ads pay for the content." First the ads are part of the contend and that part SUUUUUUUUUCKS. Second, risking being the target of someone in a past story, HoneyBlaine don\'t care.
"I'm getting very tired of this line of nonsense. What is now the most valuable public company in the world, (Alphabet), gets the vast majority of it's revenue from simple, unobtrusive, ads that they don't even charge for unless someone clicks. $Billions in revenue from doing ads right."
"You can still skip all the commercials you want. You just have to push the button. It's not that big of a deal. Generally 6 times on the 30 second skip button equals 3 minutes of a normal commercial break. 30 seconds forward, 8 seconds back in general. No waiting days. I generally wait 30 minutes from when a program starts and then play. I don't watch anything LIVE. I don't watch commercials on TV at all."
his really only effect the laziest of people I guess. It will have very little effect. Just a bunch of wasted money going to court over this.
"You can get a TIVO Bolt and it has commercial skip. It's for only a number of channels in a time period. You hit the skip button once and it'll skip them all during that commercial break. There's no waiting days or even hours. To get around the laws, TIVO has real people watching and marking the commercial breaks manually. So you can't watch in the middle of the show and use it, you have to wait a little bit until after it's over and then it works. "
"In general these company's really lost the WAR. To this day people can still record the content and skip on past it. It just can't be automated I guess from the company. Maybe if DISH could do the same thing my VHS player did. Instead of DISH doing the marking of commercials for everyone. Everyone's DVR just did it on it's own. Which in effects gets around the rules. After it's done recording it goes back and marks what it things are the commercials. In fact you could set this up yourself using Windows Media Center and some software which would do exactly that."
12:15pm
his is exactly the kind of bullshit that made me drop any form of broadcast television. I am certainly much happier for it, and have managed to improve my reading rate exponentially.
12:17pm
"Since I don't use Primetime Anytime (because I only watch 4-5 primetime shows on the networks), this affects me ZERO."
You can still manually skip ahead 30 seconds blindly (without viewing commercials).
12:19pm
"And they continue to wonder why people are turning to other sources to get what they want to see. Sorry guys but it's not the 50's anymore, welcome to the 21st century, learn to adapt quickly for once instead of wasting hundreds of millions on stupid and pointless lawsuits."
12:31pm
here isn\'t any evidence that Dish got any sort of CBS content to use on Sling as part of their settlement, and the fact they didn\'t mention it with Fox suggest that didn\'t happen here either. Moreover, ABC still isn\'t on Sling despite ABC supposedly being the reason the Disney networks are on Sling to begin with. I\'m guessing cause and effect might be backwards: Dish wanted ESPN for Sling and Disney said "only if you block AutoHop for ABC shows", which opened the door to reaching the same agreement with CBS and Fox without the Sling agreements.
"Torrented TV shows don't have commercials. All the networks are doing is to make free a totally superior viewing experience to giving them your money."
"I'm glad we dropped Dish and are just using XBMC/Kodi on our main TV. Only payment is for Internet. Currently that's a cable provider with no limits and typically get 17-25Mbps even during primetime. "
"We can watch almost any tv series if it's ever been on and almost any movie, even many of the current ones in theatres without much hassle. Heck, even watching live sports isn't that big of a deal as long as you find a good source."
he Chinese are selling software that will do this in place of the cringing Dish, you can pay for it with your credit card. Not to worry, they already have all of your credit and health care info.
"I'd be pretty pissed off if I was a Dish customer and signed up for a service promising me autoskip...and then they went and bent over for CBS and Fox. I'd probably have to cut down the satellite dish on my roof."

So my TIVO is recording all the broadcast channels in HD and 5.1 surround sound LEGALLY. That 30 second skip button works great. hit it 6 times and that's 3 minutes.

"Ad in Netflix, which is better then ever. Ton's of Content. Lots of great Original programming with a ton more for 2016. Lots and lots of Kids programming. The price is still great and it's all commercial free. With a Antenna and TIVO and Netflix, that takes up most of my viewing time. Plus I have a 800+ Movies on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-Ray. Most of them I've ripped and put on my NAS and then I put my discs into a 300 disc binder as a backup in my closet. Takes up a fraction of the space and I can watch that content using PLEX in any room in my house. No need to dig out a disc. Looks and sounds great. In fact because of PLEX, I can watch any of that content anywhere in the world with a Internet connection on my iPhone for example, or PC, or Airplay to a AppleTV. It's like my own personal Netflix service, but it's all content I like and it doesn't come and go."
"all of the original 2012 lawsuits have now been put to bed -- but at the cost of innovation and customer satisfaction."
"It's not particularly innovative to come up with a way of helping people avoiding paying for stuff - and yes, you pay for network TV by giving up a certain amount of time for commercials. Dish was trying to sell the benefits of network TV with none of the related costs, except of course to their own benefit."

It\'s precisely this sort of sad, trite logic that has been extended to "if you change the channel or leave your seat to go to the toilet during an ad, it\'s stealing".
But then again, considering your views on police restraint, such a leap of logic is probably par for the course.
Have you considered spreading your wisdom to the masses, that if they do not stay attentive throughout the entire duration of an advertisement, it counts as dollars stolen from corporations? Surely such intellectual epiphany would be widely accepted instead of being treated as utter nonsense, right?
"Wow, what a pile of troll bait. Too bad I won't fall for it."
"It\'s precisely this sort of sad, trite logic that has been extended to "if you change the channel or leave your seat to go to the toilet during an ad, it\'s stealing".
Untrue. My point of discussion is that of a business model, and not your attempt to spin people\'s opinion. The business models is "the TV shows are free, but you must put up with the commercials". Like any situation, if a few people skip over them nobody freaks out. But there is a point where if the numbers get too low, then the value of the ad drops, the income drops, and the shows can\'t be produced (at least not at the same level) as they are now.
" considering your views on police restraint"
"Considering your attempts at trolling and your gross exaggerations of other people's opinions, it's doubtful you have much good to add. Back to sleep troll!"
10:49am
"On the flip side, people skipping the commercials (or, like myself, simply refuse to watch ad-supported TV at all) is just the free market in action. If so many people so it that the shows cannot be sustained in that way, it's just people collectively saying that the shows aren't worth the commercial load."
"^This. None of us is obliged to uphold a business model. If it fails, that's market forces at work. Commercial natural selection, as it were."
"Actually, network execs have made the exact argument that not viewing an ad when its on is tantamount to stealing, derived from the logic you claim isn't. Thanks for playing. Now go back to looking for PaulTs under your bed."
"There you go again, assuming anyone who disagrees with you is a troll. Seriously, you should share your views with the public and see how well they're received."
"By the way, I'm not PaulT, but you'll probably think otherwise."
Bull (as is usual for you). The result would likely be a different model, but there would still be shows.
"I've been skipping commercials since before the DVR using my VHS player that actually had commercial Skip built in!!! I got my first DVR, TIVO back in late 1999 and really have watch very few commercials since then."
"My brothers Kids didn't know what a commercial was until not long ago when they went to someone else's house and saw them for the first time and thought they were neat! Because they only watched DVD's or Netflix for Kids!!!"
"Of course there's no free lunch which is why there's all this product placement in programs these days. It's not generic names these days, it's COKE, Chevy, etc right there in front of show. The MS Surface product ad's in programs are quite annoying."
"No, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are irrefutable proof that people are willing to pay a reasonable fee for access to content that doesn't aggressively bombard them with in-your-face advertising. The old networks will figure this out to their benefit, or not figure it out to their peril. They need to realize that the consumer gets a vote in all this."
"Ad companies have driven the customer away from traditional media. The BS that ads pay for things doesn't equate to those companies being in a pest industry. "

iVo Brings Skip Mode to TiVo Roamio
I never thought it would happen - but TiVo has brought the "Skip Mode" functionality, previously an exclusive feature of the TiVo Bolt, to the Roamio line of TiVos with a recent software update. From TiVo
iVo Roamio users can now skip commercial breaks with the press of a button on over 80% of the most popular shows on the top 20 networks. A few minutes after a show has aired, a SKIP icon will appear next to the title in your My Shows folder. When watching a Skip-eligible show, press the \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button at the commercial break and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be back to your show instantly
iVo has now brought two of its hallmark features from the new Bolt DVR,\xc2\xa0
", to the Roamio line. The upgrade is coming as a staged rollout to Roamio boxes and supported Minis. TiVo says compatable devices that are network-connected should receive the update by March 10th. \xc2\xa0As a fairly recent Roamio purchaser I'm thrilled to see TiVo continue to upgrade the platform."

ew TiVo DVR will skip through entire commercial break
\t  \n\t\tPublished 10:55  AM ET Wed, 30 Sept 2015\n\t
iVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours."
"Satellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompting lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish's commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station."
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney.
"We\'re not changing the underlying content," Denney said in an interview. "We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly."
he TiVo Bolt also has a "quick mode" that plays back recordings 30 percent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\'t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for "How I Met Your Mother" for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
"The TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device's full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo's starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away."

eports indicate that TiVo is mostly manually tagging popular TV shows with markers that are downloaded to the Bolt. New solution to an old problem. For example, Engadget reports
"TiVo is managing this by basically having people watch the programs on\xc2\xa0 certain networks (the top 20 or so most popular, between 4PM and\xc2\xa0 midnight) and mark where the actual show begins and the commercials end.\xc2\xa0 Your Bolt downloads the information, and is ready for skipping at will\xc2\xa0 shortly after the shows are recorded. You'll know which shows have\xc2\xa0 commercials that can be skipped, because they've got a big green skip\xc2\xa0 button in the guide now. "

oesn\'t work as is "doesn\'t show the icon and ding at commercial break" or "pressing D doesn\'t do anything"?
"\r\nSometimes I don't see the notification or hear the ding, but the D button still works."
Yeah, this is the only issue I have encountered as well. Occasionaly, the "ding" and on-screen prompts are missing for a Skip tagged show, but that\'s it.
"\r\nSkip is highly dependent upon Closed Captioning. I would recommend watching the Closed Captions for shows you're having trouble with. If they looked jumbled or glitched, that is likely why you're having so much trouble. In that case, you need to contact your Cable provider and complain. This is a serious compliance issue with Federal regulations and they will fall over themselves to fix it quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

Others have commented on your issue, so nothing to add there.  But I wanted to make sure you were aware this answer you were given is total BS. Networks don\'t "mark" their commercials, TiVo does it for us, as part of the SM process. As far as they are concerned, networks don\'t even know TiVo does this, or has SkipMode.
"\r\nHard to believe someone would actually say that. I'm not doubting you, just saying of all the answers to give, making that up is far left field.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"Hard to believe someone would actually say that. I'm not doubting you, just saying of all the answers to give, making that up is far left field."
"Thanks for the comments, now I know it probably is with my setup. The tech got that answer from this board! She couldn't find anything in the TiVo notes so she resorted to going to this forum, or the Bolt forum to be specific, which I think is pretty funny. Why bother with TiVo, just come here!"

"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf she continued searching here, she would've asked you if you were a Comcast customer and if your channels are switching to mpeg4 as skip does not appear to work with mpeg4.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"If she continued searching here, she would've asked you if you were a Comcast customer and if your channels are switching to mpeg4 as skip does not appear to work with mpeg4."
"I believe with the MPEG4 issue you don't get the Skip indication on the show though."
"I believe with the MPEG4 issue you don't get the Skip indication on the show though.  Scott"
You may be right. That has been unclear in most of the conversation.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"I have a few shows that show the icon but when I press D it does nothing. I posted a thread here about it a while ago. No one else corroborated, and I haven't seen it since, so I assumed it was a couple of bad recordings or something."
"This happens to me occasionally, but I'm not sure if it's exactly the same situation as yours.  What happens to me is that I play a show which has the skip icon next to it, but when the show first plays, it doesn't show the skip info message above the progress bar.  At that point, I know that skip won't work.  But if I go back to the show list and immediately play the show again, it will somehow load the skip data correctly the 2nd time, give me the skip info message above the progress bar, and then skip will work.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

o I still have these recordings. (couple software versions now) They show the Skip banner when the show starts but pressing D does nothing. This happend on 3 shows from different networks on different nights, but the same week.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy situation seems to be unique, at least to the extent skip doesn't work. "
"\r\nI do get the skip icon next to the show. I also sometimes get it when the show starts playing, not always. However, I don't get it when there's a commercial break along with the ping sound that plays - except for those times that it works."
\r\nI have Verizon FIOS, not Comcast and know nothing about MPEG-4. 
\r\nI find it one of the best features TiVo has come up with in a long time and will pursue it further with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've seen Skip work a couple times on programs that had no Skip icon. Guess there's nothing to lose by hitting D to give it a shot...\n\t\t\t\t\t"

iVo Zaps Spots for Its Commercial-Killing Gizmo Bolt
Low-Key Bolt Launch Keeps Ad-Skip Button Under Wraps
"\n\t\tTivo's\xc2\xa0'Premature Playage' commercial appears to have aired on TV exactly one time. Credit: Courtesy Tivo Inc. via YouTube\n \t"
One of the key selling points of the new 
he first Bolt ad to focus entirely on the advanced ad-zapping functionality was a 15-second spot that aired in the third quarter of NFL Network\'s telecast of the Nov. 12 Bills-Jets game. Running a few weeks after TiVo first rolled out its new entertainment platform, the "Here Come the Commercials" spot was seen by approximately 8 million viewers. The ad, which features a couple engaging in commercial interruptus, closes with a wholly unambiguous tag line: "The all-new TiVo Bolt. Skip entire commercials with a press of a button."
"Here Come the Commercials" popped up one last time before going inactive, appearing in the second quarter of NFL Net\'s Dec. 10 Vikings-Cardinals telecast.
Hulu Teaches Irony in Spot for Ad-Free Service
 second ad that explicitly sings the praises of ad avoidance aired just once before it too disappeared. The 30-second 
"Premature Playage" is more or less the Platonic Ideal of overwrought marketing, trotting out a faux physician, wailing infant, emasculating wife, surly goth teen and a debilitating shot to the groin of the paterfamilias in the space of its brief run. The upshot of this ad is that people who try to fast-forward through commercial pods with their traditional DVRs tend to overshoot the last spot, thereby impinging on the programming they actually want to watch. The phony doc\'s prescription? Skip the pods seamlessly with TiVo Bolt.
"Oddly enough, TiVo's exhortation to surgically excise TV ads is nowhere to be found in its extant Bolt spot, which is titled "
 TiVo representative did not respond to a request for comment.
ccording to iSpot.tv estimates, "It Eats Commercials" is doing all the heavy lifting for TiVo, having aired 229 times since it bowed back on Oct. 5. The company has shelled out around $870,000 for all that inventory, although the dollars appear to be drying up; per iSpot, the last paid-for airing was on Dec. 17, during the Rockets-Lakers game on TNT.
ven without any overt nods to commercial avoidance, the networks haven\'t exactly fallen all over themselves in their haste to air the "It Eats Commercials" spot. In the three months it has been in circulation, the TiVo ad has appeared only on TNT, Pac-12 Network and NBA TV. "It Eats Commercials" has aired exclusively in live NBA games and shoulder programming, as well as in Pac-12 college football telecasts.
"While most ad-supported networks are likely to steer clear of future Bolt spots, the brand's sports-heavy TV buy also makes a good deal of sense. For one thing, the fact that sports are almost exclusively watched live eliminates much of the ad avoidance that plagues time-shifted programming."
"But with Bolt, as it happens, sports is bulletproof. Tivo's new skip function doesn't work on pre-recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
he limitations of the device are not inconsiderable. At present, skip mode is available for shows recorded from just 20 network feeds, a roster that includes the Big Five broadcasters as well as cable heavyweights like 
", TBS, TNT and USA Network. TiVo's new skip function also doesn't work on recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
\'s "Squawk Box," outgoing TiVo CEO Tom Rogers denied that Bolt was a commercial killer, even though it is (stealthily) being marketed as such. "We know, with DVR behavior, people still watch a lot of commercials even though they have the ability to fast-forward," he said. "We know, even with this, they\'ll still get a lot of commercials coming through."
"That the networks haven't gone on the offensive against Bolt may well be a function of the company's relatively limited impact on the overall TV ecosystem. Per its most recent 10-Q filing with the FCC, TiVo reported that it serves 6.47 million subscribers, a tally that includes 952,000 customers who own their own units and 5.52 million who rent a box from their cable operator. And while that marks a 26% increase from the year-ago period, TiVo's sub base represents just 6% of the 116.4 million U.S. TV households."
Broadcasters were far more proactive four years ago, after 
ish this week unveiled the Hopper 3 at CES.
If it seems counterintuitive for ad-supportive networks to allow disruptive technologies to promote their wares on their air, executives say that money often trumps ideology. "Retweets are not endorsements, and neither is my decision to take money from someone who may or may not be trying to put me out of business," cracked one senior ad sales exec. "We let Netflix advertise all the time, and if you listen to Reed Hastings, they\'re going to kill us all in the next five years."
etflix has spent $5.79 million on national TV since the 2015-16 broadcast season began back in September.

Men with performance anxiety learn to skip whole commercial breaks at once in three hilarious commercials
pparently there are people out there who don\xe2\x80\x99t like watching commercials. Even harder to believe: Some of these people have a really hard time fast-forwarding through them with a standard DVR. To accommodate these folks, TiVo is introducing Bolt, the DVR that skips whole commercial breaks with the touch of a button.
o make its point \xe2\x80\x94 and because TiVo appreciates irony \xe2\x80\x94 the company asked creative shop School (a purpose-driven ad agency\xc2\xa0under the Project:WorldWide network)\xc2\xa0to make a few commercials. Finally, the struggle to avoid seeing ads gets the crotch shot it deserves.

ew TiVo Device Lets Viewers Easily Skip the Entire Commercial Break \xe2\x80\x94 But Will the Networks Play Along?
 new device from TiVo may not sit well with TV networks \xe2\x80\x94 and may revive the kind of anxiety that greeted Dish\xe2\x80\x99s Hopper, which sparked lawsuits from a number of networks.
he device is the new TiVo Bolt, which boasts a feature called SkipMode. \xe2\x80\x9cWith one press of a button on the remote, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break,\xe2\x80\x9d the 
he Bolt tags the beginning and ending of commercial breaks, enabling users to skip that section when they\xe2\x80\x99re playing back the programming they\xe2\x80\x99ve recorded.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours,\xe2\x80\x9d the AP notes.
nother feature of the Bolt is its \xe2\x80\x9cquick mode,\xe2\x80\x9d which plays back recorded programs 30 percent faster, using software to adjust the pitch on the audio. \xe2\x80\x9cWith this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour,\xe2\x80\x9d the AP reports.
Will the new device prompt a round of lawsuits? The report notes that satellite provider Dish continues to deal with suits over the Hopper.
\xe2\x80\x9cDish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish\xe2\x80\x99s lineup,\xe2\x80\x9d the AP notes. \xe2\x80\x9cIn an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish\xe2\x80\x99s commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station.\xe2\x80\x9d
iVo apparently hopes to avoid similar legal problems with the Bolt and SkipMode, pointing out that it is up to viewers to activate the ad-skipping feature.
aid TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not changing the underlying content. We\xe2\x80\x99re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\xe2\x80\x99re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d

As a result, if YouTube TV has the on-demand version of a specific program you may be interested in, then the service won't let viewers watch a recorded version that allows for ad-skipping. Instead, viewers are forced to watch the on-demand episode and all of the ads, even if consumers thought they saved the show on their DVR for ad-skippable viewing. "

Broadcasters Put New Ad-Skipping Restrictions On YouTube TV
Broadcasters Put New Ad-Skipping Restrictions On YouTube TV

"Let's be clear here: Broadcasters didn't do this, YouTube (AKA Alphabet) did this.  Broadcasters asked for this -- maybe even demanded this, or traded this for lower costs -- and YouTube decided that having their content, plus ads, was more important than sticking to their guns and offering their customers (the people who actually pay money for the service) an ads-free experience."
o, broadcasters did this.  " maybe even demanded this".  Almost certainly demanded this as part of offering the content.  Alphabet\'s choices were to offer the service with that restriction or have nothing to offer.  Saying Alphabet did this and it\'s all their fault is like blaming the authorities for doing/not doing something when a hostage taker kills a hostage.
If Alphabet offers everything else but their content, where is the content going to go.  Facebook?  Bing?
"Think about it then ask yourself, who has the biggest streaming platform on the internet?  Nix that, what company exists which have more cash reserves than all of the broadcasters combined?  That may be taken too literally, but the odds are stacked far from the broadcaster's favor based on Netflix and Amazon action."

hink about it then ask yourself, who has the biggest streaming platform on the internet?
etflix, which already eats up the fattest chunk of downstream bandwidth, is taking an even bigger bite: The No. 1 subscription-video service accounted for 36.5% of all downstream Internet bandwidth during peak periods in North America for March, according to a new report.
By comparison, for the same time periods, YouTube accounted for 15.6% of downstream Internet traffic, web browsing was 6%, Facebook was 2.7%, Amazon Instant Video was 2.0% and Hulu was 1.9%.

etflix is certainly winning in hours of viewing. YouTube may actually have more videos watched because most of its content is short things that last only a few minutes, while Netflix content starts at 20 minutes or so ("half hour" TV episodes) and goes up to over two hours (longer films).
If Alphabet offers everything else but their content, where is the content going to go. Facebook? Bing?

For those of us not as interested in illegality, there is also Netflix, YouTube Red (for normal YT content without ads plus some unique programming), Hulu Plus (a few things will have a very short, single ad at the beginning and end), and purchasing tv seasons and movies a la carte via any number of services (Amazon, Google, etc).
"That's fine until you want to watch something that's not available on those services, in which case, ads it is. I personally have a subscription to both Netflix and HBO."

o you subscribe and buy a DVR.  Having to start streaming a show 15 minutes ahead so it can skip adds is annoying but not a show stopper.

You\'re kidding, right? "Google has confirmed with the Journal that the restriction is courtesy of the licensing agreements the broadcast industry forced Google to adhere to in order to offer the service." The largest portion of Google/Alphabet\'s income is advertising revenue - I\'d be surprised if they protested the broadcasters\' request in any way, shape or form.

o let me get this straight, some the fuck how, advertisers think people will buy their products when they force them sit through those busker screams. Oh yes I will buy your product after you force me, actively force me to watch you shit, now honestly is that true, talk about self delusion. 
"I don't know about other people but piss me off with a commercial and I likely will not only not buy your product but not buy if for a long time. "
You might as well think it is worthwhile to punch people in the face because it really attracts their attention, so punch them in the face, scream about your products and then reinforce the message by kicking them in the genitals, oh yeah, they will remember your product but will they buy it? In a choice between watching content and watching some shit advert, I simply switch to alternate content, done and finished. So much choice, so little time, so meh. Google and Alphabet as run by the big shit are just full of it (total control, total power insanity).

"Not only do they think that. They know it works. Sure, you won't and I won't, but then the chance of us buying anything from them compared to the people would would not before and will now is highly in favor of ads."
I used to work for a marketing company. Marketing people are not interested in who will not buy their product. They are interested who will buy their product. And if the profit is higher than the cost of the ads, it is good.
ay they have 1% of the people are a customer. They advertise aggressively to everybody. They will lose 50% of their customer base. They gain 1% of the others. That means they are now around 1.5% An increase of 0.5% of their customer base. That means the ads where successful.
"Other way to look at it: if it wasn't successful, they would not do it."
hey do not care about you not buying the product. They do not care about 99% of the people not buying the product. You are not their target audience. And if that means you are not watching tv, cable, movies or do not read newspapers or whatever, they are ok with that.
"You are unimportant to them. Don't forget that. You are not a customer and you never will be, so why would they care?"
You might as well think it is worthwhile to punch people in the face because it really attracts their attention
"That's what they do! Adverts are often significantly louder than the programming, and much more obnoxious. It's not unlike being slapped in the face with a wet fish, with the sudden onslaught of sound and bright flashing images."
"You realize YouTube TV costs $35/month, right? Unlike YouTube, the free user-content-streaming platform, this is a premium channel with a cost that is approximately 3.5 times Netflix (which has no ads) or Hulu (which does have ads, unless you pay about half the price of YouTube TV to not have ads).\n\nI'm not saying they're evil for having ads, or that they're bad people, but this is not the same as a free service, and they made conscious decisions that involved supporting ads.

In  the past TV was something I could watch and talk about with friends of what we watched the day before or the previous week. With all content available all the time, it became less likely that I could talk with friends over what they and I watched, so the social part was gone.

Streaming gives them that power, and it is often irresistible- something they don\'t have over DVR\'s.

ew TiVo Bolt taking forever on Getting Setup Info
Can I use Tivo to stream without a subscription?
iVo Roamio OTA compatible with cable? Thanks!
"Can't sign into Amazon Prime on TiVo Bolt"
I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of purchasing TiVo Roamio OTA 1 TB and wondering if there is really no monthly payment. It just seems to good to be true.

"This is an archived post. You won't be able to vote or comment."
"I didn't think my TiVo Roamio OTA could get much better.   "
hat green D button is gonna get a lot of use now!  
who knew we all wanted the D so badly?
You can also use the channel up button.  Easier to find.
"This. Channel up is, to me, more intuitive anyway. Plus, on my Harmony it's harder to reach the D button."
But damn, my Tivo has been unstable as crap since the update.

I love skip mode..this is a great feature.
"Anyone know how they're doing this? Tagging them by hand, or does it analyze the recording?"
"Tagging by hand is what I read somewhere.  That's why it's not every show. "
"It's manual tagging. Seems TiVo is trying to avoid some of the commercial skipping lawsuits of the 2012-2014 period."
I was really impressed when watching a mythbusters episode that it stopped for the short 30sec "outtake" that is buried in the ads, then I was able to skip again to the rest of the actual show.
 button is love, D button is life.
I could only wish that it was available on more shows. It makes TV so enjoyable!
"Ok, I've got a few questions about skip mode.  If i'm watching a show recorded on my roamio that was recorded on another tivo (series 4, 4 tuner) via Multi room viewing can i still use the skip mode?  Also, will my TiVo mini allow me to skip if it is playing back shows from a roamio that has skip mode?"
I can answer the second part and definitely say that shows recorded on my Roamio Pro are skip mode enabled from my Tivo Minis.
"How come mine doesn't work?\nTivo Series 5\nSoftware 20.5.6.RC21-USA-6-846"
he D and channel up both do nothing.
Only works on shows with the tag. 
Finally got it on my ota. Woo!
Congrats!  It\'s funny now when we watch a show, and try to skip, and it\'s not available...  "Aww man, i gotta fast forward?!?"   LOL!
re you sure it rolled out to your Tivo?  Did you get a message on the box?  
"Also, I think it's only Roamio and Bolt models that get it."
I have forced a connect a couple of times this week for different reasons, and still no message about it...must be like when they rolled out comcast on demand and be regional
I\'m surprised how many shows have it, especially if they are doing it "manually".  Great feature though.

ew TiVo DVR will skip through entire commercial break
\t  \n\t\tPublished 10:55  AM ET Wed, 30 Sept 2015\n\t
iVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours."
"Satellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompting lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish's commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station."
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney.
"We\'re not changing the underlying content," Denney said in an interview. "We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly."
he TiVo Bolt also has a "quick mode" that plays back recordings 30 percent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\'t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for "How I Met Your Mother" for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
"The TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device's full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo's starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away."
"Wednesday's announcement comes a day after "
. began selling upgrades to its $35 Chromecast video-streaming device. It also launched a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service. A few weeks ago, Amazon.com Inc. refreshed its streaming-TV devices. The new Fire TV, selling for $100 and shipping next week, will also support 4K video streaming. 
iVo finally tells TV broadcasters to stuff it
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
lmost from its inception, TiVo, the San Jose company whose device has given the generic name to\xc2\xa0digital video recorders, has had an uneasy relationship with the broadcasting industry. But with the release last week of a new model of TiVo recorder dubbed the Bolt, the firm is encouraging customers to 
\xc2\xa0in its indelicate words. This is a big change from the past.\xc2\xa0
"A quick look at the history of TiVo. By\xc2\xa0allowing viewers to fast-forward through commercials (not to mention the dull stretches of\xc2\xa0TV programs), devices like TiVo's threatened the very principle of advertising-supported TV."
"TiVo and its original competitor, ReplayTV--both introduced their products in 1999--took different approaches to this option. Through a button on the Replay remote, you could skip commercials entirely, 30 seconds\xc2\xa0at a time. Broadcasters hated that. TiVo took a kinder, gentler approach: You could fast-forward, but not skip. That meant that you would still be exposed to the commercials, albeit\xc2\xa0at turbo-speed. That mollified broadcasters and advertisers somewhat, and it fed into the company's strategy of reaching lucrative cooperative agreements with the networks.\xc2\xa0"
It was a combination of accepting reality (fast-forward was a functionality that\xc2\xa0TiVo buyers demanded) and leaving broadcasters with at least a crumb of outreach to viewers. It may not have detracted much from the DVR experience, which was as compelling as a thunderclap.
\xc2\xa0that during all the years when\xc2\xa0high-tech entrepreneurs would march\xc2\xa0through The Times offices showing off their innovative products, only once did I ever see one that made me think, "This will change my life." It was the\xc2\xa0ReplayTV box, and its potential for completely changing the TV viewing experience was instantly apparent.
"There just aren't enough of you to sustain the company's retail business alone."
\xe2\x80\x94 TiVo executive Ira Bahr to a forum of TiVo enthusiasts
"TiVo's strategy of cozying up to broadcasters, which included offering promotional space on the TiVo box to be pushed at users, enabled the firm to outlast ReplayTV, which\xc2\xa0finally disappeared after several ownership changes.\xc2\xa0But it hasn't yielded consistent profitability--TiVo didn't report\xc2\xa0its first annual profit until 2009, and it has lost money\xc2\xa0in six\xc2\xa0of its last 10\xc2\xa0fiscal years."
"So here comes the Bolt. The serpentine-shaped unit, which will sell for up to $400 with a one-year programming subscription included, offers two new features. One is Skip Mode, a return to the ReplayTV past, which allows users to skip entire commercial breaks at the press of a button. The other is Quick Mode, which allows playback of recorded shows 30% faster, with the audio electronically tweaked so the actors don't all sound like quacking ducks. (Broadcasters might\xc2\xa0not care about that, though content producers might hate it.)"
"Skip Mode is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that the heyday of interpolated broadcast TV commercials is over. It's also a sign of TiVo's new strategy, which\xc2\xa0is to appeal to cord-cutting viewers who get more of their video from subscription sources without commercials, such as Netflix, HBO Now\xc2\xa0and Amazon Prime. Even so, "
\xc2\xa0only for shows on the most popular\xc2\xa020 networks or so, and for shows airing between 4 p.m. and midnight.
"The Bolt itself is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that TiVo's overall business model--selling full-featured DVRs for up to $600 and charging annual subscription fees of $150--is tapped out. Subscriptions are stagnating, and the set-top boxes rented to customers by cable and satellite systems typically incorporate their own DVRs."
iVo added 150,000 subscriptions last year, its chief marketing officer, Ira Bahr, told 
an online forum of loyal TiVo customers
\xc2\xa0last week. "There just aren\'t enough of you to sustain the company\xe2\x80\x99s retail business alone," he said. "Compare that to the millions of streamers out there, and the tens of millions of DVRs out there,\xc2\xa0and you see that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of ground to make up."\xc2\xa0
Whether TiVo will survive the continued evolution of TV is anyone\'s guess. It was successful at upending the business model of broadcasting and cable, but it hasn\'t been the victor in the free-for-all that followed. It\'s still fighting for its life--if it can\'t expand its market, Bahr said, "we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to do much of anything."
s streaming video takes over, the DVR record-at-home model may vanish, too; the box streaming your\xc2\xa0Netflix or Amazon Prime choices\xc2\xa0has no moving parts to break down, and of course no commercials to skip.

eports indicate that TiVo is mostly manually tagging popular TV shows with markers that are downloaded to the Bolt. New solution to an old problem. For example, Engadget reports

iVo Zaps Spots for Its Commercial-Killing Gizmo Bolt
Low-Key Bolt Launch Keeps Ad-Skip Button Under Wraps
"\n\t\tTivo's\xc2\xa0'Premature Playage' commercial appears to have aired on TV exactly one time. Credit: Courtesy Tivo Inc. via YouTube\n \t"
One of the key selling points of the new 
he first Bolt ad to focus entirely on the advanced ad-zapping functionality was a 15-second spot that aired in the third quarter of NFL Network\'s telecast of the Nov. 12 Bills-Jets game. Running a few weeks after TiVo first rolled out its new entertainment platform, the "Here Come the Commercials" spot was seen by approximately 8 million viewers. The ad, which features a couple engaging in commercial interruptus, closes with a wholly unambiguous tag line: "The all-new TiVo Bolt. Skip entire commercials with a press of a button."
"Here Come the Commercials" popped up one last time before going inactive, appearing in the second quarter of NFL Net\'s Dec. 10 Vikings-Cardinals telecast.
Hulu Teaches Irony in Spot for Ad-Free Service
 second ad that explicitly sings the praises of ad avoidance aired just once before it too disappeared. The 30-second 
"Premature Playage" is more or less the Platonic Ideal of overwrought marketing, trotting out a faux physician, wailing infant, emasculating wife, surly goth teen and a debilitating shot to the groin of the paterfamilias in the space of its brief run. The upshot of this ad is that people who try to fast-forward through commercial pods with their traditional DVRs tend to overshoot the last spot, thereby impinging on the programming they actually want to watch. The phony doc\'s prescription? Skip the pods seamlessly with TiVo Bolt.
"Oddly enough, TiVo's exhortation to surgically excise TV ads is nowhere to be found in its extant Bolt spot, which is titled "
 TiVo representative did not respond to a request for comment.
ccording to iSpot.tv estimates, "It Eats Commercials" is doing all the heavy lifting for TiVo, having aired 229 times since it bowed back on Oct. 5. The company has shelled out around $870,000 for all that inventory, although the dollars appear to be drying up; per iSpot, the last paid-for airing was on Dec. 17, during the Rockets-Lakers game on TNT.
ven without any overt nods to commercial avoidance, the networks haven\'t exactly fallen all over themselves in their haste to air the "It Eats Commercials" spot. In the three months it has been in circulation, the TiVo ad has appeared only on TNT, Pac-12 Network and NBA TV. "It Eats Commercials" has aired exclusively in live NBA games and shoulder programming, as well as in Pac-12 college football telecasts.
"While most ad-supported networks are likely to steer clear of future Bolt spots, the brand's sports-heavy TV buy also makes a good deal of sense. For one thing, the fact that sports are almost exclusively watched live eliminates much of the ad avoidance that plagues time-shifted programming."
"But with Bolt, as it happens, sports is bulletproof. Tivo's new skip function doesn't work on pre-recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
he limitations of the device are not inconsiderable. At present, skip mode is available for shows recorded from just 20 network feeds, a roster that includes the Big Five broadcasters as well as cable heavyweights like 
", TBS, TNT and USA Network. TiVo's new skip function also doesn't work on recorded sports programming, so anyone looking to scoot through a time-shifted game won't be able to zap through the commercial pods."
\'s "Squawk Box," outgoing TiVo CEO Tom Rogers denied that Bolt was a commercial killer, even though it is (stealthily) being marketed as such. "We know, with DVR behavior, people still watch a lot of commercials even though they have the ability to fast-forward," he said. "We know, even with this, they\'ll still get a lot of commercials coming through."
"That the networks haven't gone on the offensive against Bolt may well be a function of the company's relatively limited impact on the overall TV ecosystem. Per its most recent 10-Q filing with the FCC, TiVo reported that it serves 6.47 million subscribers, a tally that includes 952,000 customers who own their own units and 5.52 million who rent a box from their cable operator. And while that marks a 26% increase from the year-ago period, TiVo's sub base represents just 6% of the 116.4 million U.S. TV households."
Broadcasters were far more proactive four years ago, after 
ish this week unveiled the Hopper 3 at CES.
If it seems counterintuitive for ad-supportive networks to allow disruptive technologies to promote their wares on their air, executives say that money often trumps ideology. "Retweets are not endorsements, and neither is my decision to take money from someone who may or may not be trying to put me out of business," cracked one senior ad sales exec. "We let Netflix advertise all the time, and if you listen to Reed Hastings, they\'re going to kill us all in the next five years."
etflix has spent $5.79 million on national TV since the 2015-16 broadcast season began back in September.

his new Bolt DVR may not totally remake the recording technology TiVo is famous for, but it introduces a sharp departure in design and adds features customers have asked for since it started in the late 90s. 
", the Bolt is a funky arc-shaped white box that looks different from anything else near your HDTV. Despite being smaller than TiVo's older DVRs -- or whatever cable box you probably have -- it's eye-catching enough for visitors to stop and ask what you're watching TV on. Looks aside, Bolt's main claim to fame will definitely be its ability to bypass commercials with a new SkipMode (No more hidden 30 second skip! "
"We've been asking for this since 2009"
", and while it's appreciated, where I see evidence of TiVo looking towards the future is the way it's connecting the DVR to Amazon's Fire TV. "
\n            Gallery: TiVo Bolt | 10 Photos\n          
"Let's start with the new hardware. TiVo Bolt will replace "
"That funky arc shape isn't just there to stick out visually however, as VP Jim Denney told us it also allows the smaller box to vent from the bottom. It's a rather unique design, and in our short time using it the box stayed cool and quiet. The upgraded hardware is good for more than just pixel-pushing too, with apps and menus responding faster than ever. One tweak you'd almost miss? It still has the Roamio Pro's tiny Remote Finder button on the back, perfect for times when the RF-connected control has slipped between couch cushions somewhere. In general, things are the same as they ever were, including stuff like CableCARD setups, and transferring your Series Recordings via TiVo's sometimes-frustrating website. That's definitely one aspect that could use a 2015-style makeover to resemble modernized platforms like iOS, Xbox or Spotify."
he biggest changes however, are in the software. With "SkipMode" TiVo drops in a feature featured its old competitor 
, and more recently by Dish Network\'s "
" DVRs. It works just like it sounds, when you\'re watching a recorded program, a green icon will pop up and prompt you to hit the "D" button to skip commercials. Easy, right? Right, but there are some limitations. TiVo is managing this by basically having people watch the programs on certain networks (the top 20 or so most popular, between 4PM and midnight) and mark where the actual show begins and the commercials end. Your Bolt downloads the information, and is ready for skipping at will shortly after the shows are recorded. You\'ll know which shows have commercials that can be skipped, because they\'ve got a big green skip button in the guide now. The only bad news? SkipMode is not being ported back to older DVRs, but it should work on the Mini (as long as it\'s connected to a Bolt.)
"We tried it out and everything worked without a hitch. TiVo's scheme covers the lions share of our primetime TV programming, and being able to easily skip commercials can make it easier to blow through shows quickly. In that same vein, TiVo is also adding QuickMode (unlike SkipMode, this will be available for the Roamio and Premiere), which lets viewers watch recordings sped up by 30 percent, but pitch corrects the audio so it doesn't sound any different. Many of you told us you listened to the old HD Podcast that way, and we can confirm, if you're bingeing on a series to catch up before the finale, it makes things go by faster without seriously compromising the experience."
"What we didn't get a chance to try was the Bolt's Ultra HD chops, but according to TiVo it will have two 4K-ready apps at launch: YouTube and "
. The menu has been tweaked slightly, and while that change won\'t be copied onto older hardware, Premiere and Roamio users can expect a guide update that adds more channel logos. Other software tweaks coming in a fall update will bring a personalized "What to Watch" section on iOS, better social sharing on Facebook and Twitter, and a slicker OnePass experience 
"Getting Personal \xe2\x80\x93 A Fall update will deliver new features to TiVo's iOS app that will allow you to create a personalized 'What to Watch' screen by selecting categories based on your hobbies and interests. Content matching your interests will then populate your 'My Shows' folder."

iVo Online \xe2\x80\x93 Creating OnePass selections will be easier than ever on TiVo Online with OnePass Quick Select. Upon updating, OnePass will include default options highlighting your favorite programs with a single click.

". It's not out yet, but when it launches you should be able to watch easily recordings from anywhere else in the home. With a little hacking "
people have already been doing just that
", but official support is a move in the right direction. Making TiVo work smoothly with other devices would make the ecosystem much more valuable, and I hope it's just the start of a trend."
Bolt pre-orders start today online -- check the usual sources like Amazon (
") and Best Buy -- with shipments on October 4th, and units should reach retail shelves in the next week or so. The only difference between the two versions offered are the size of the 2.5-inch HDD inside, at 500GB ($299) or 1TB ($399), and both come with the first year of TiVo service included. Is that enough to get buyers away from cable DVRs or custom setups? By including the first year of service TiVo is taking some of the upfront pricing pressure off, which is a big reason why I haven't always recommended it right away. I'd like to see more work done on those apps for other connected devices (Roku, Xbox, PlayStation... "
"?) before making the switch full time, but if you're in the mood for an upgrade, the Bolt is a great option right out of the box."

iVo has a office in North Carolina where people in cubicles determine the beginning and end points of commercial interruptions, possibly computer-aided but basically doing what is a manual process.
"The metadata describing commercials is probably pulled down when guide data is pulled.  It can't be when the program is recorded because at that point the metadata doesn't yet exist."
"I presume the data is pulled because the data required for commercial breaks is very tiny, much less than the amount of data that is pulled to display a program's other information; and it isn't available when the program is recorded.  I see the alternative of pushing all SkipMode information as possible but less likely seeing as how willing TiVo is to let us see the spinning blue circle when we ask to see the guide or an individual program's information."
"The commercial metadata is embedded in TiVo's proprietary TiVo interface protocols.  I imagine the information is well protected, as it is valuable proprietary information.  Even if I'm wrong is some of my other guesses I can't imagine TiVo giving it away."
For the same reason I doubt TiVo will make the metadata available through the RPC interface used by kmttg and TiVoDesktop.
"And I'd love to find that my analysis is completely wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

I also assumed that the skip data was pulled rather pushed. Maybe it could happen twice an hour on a push basis to cover the half hour and hour long shows.  I guess the mechanics of how it get to our machines is less important than where it gets stored locally and whether we can use it.

\nin the last 10 years there is the Dish Hopper which skipped on only 4 network stations and only during primetime.
\nThere is no way I can believe that any group of humans is manually adding the TiVo Tick marks in real time to mark commercials.

I am sure that TiVo's North Carolinas are aided by machine recognition but do a manual edit for the final chop."

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI am not saying that TiVo might employ an army to verify commercials.
\nthey may even do a lot of it manually.
\nBut there is so much technology already invented that can be improved.
\nThe army might just be to make sure there are fewer goofs than in other systems.

\nReplayTV had a very good commercial skipper that was fully automated.  It was not perfect but it was on all channels and worked quite well.  TiVo ducked the commercial skip feature and let ReplayTV fight the wars.  
\nTiVo is still here and ReplayTV is long gone, sorry to say.

And even some shows I have recorded meeting that criteria never get skip mode on my Bolts. Like iZombie and The Flash.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

Well now THAT is an interesting new feature on the Bolt! 
\nTiVo "guy" must be TiVo "gal" starting with the Bolt? 
\nSkipMode has worked well for me as well except for a couple missed shows and I also noticed this past Friday when my wife and I were watching Last Man Standing that the second to the last skip tick took us past the commercial break and to the final 30 second closing segment of the show.  We were like "wow, it\'s over already?" Then I realized it must\'ve been SkipMode that failed, and it was.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSkipMode nails the primetime stuff pretty well, but reruns, daytime, and late night coverage works for crap here.
\n4 out of 6 South Park episodes have Skip (CC reruns).
\n3 out of 8 Big Bangs have Skip. (TBS reruns)
"\n0 out of 8 Judge Judy's have Skip (NEW Fox episodes)."
"\n2 out of 5 Colbert's this week.\n\t\t\t\t\t"

Mossberg: TiVo Bolt Review: Watching TV Faster
kip commercials with one click, and speed up the rest of the show, too.
Welcome to Mossberg, a new weekly commentary and reviews column on 
Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that "TiVo has no commercial-skipping button" and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make good business sense."
It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.
nd the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. "SkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant," TiVo now boasts.
Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.
In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.
nd that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.
he latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock."
till, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.
he Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.
Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.
But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)
Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.
iVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.
o make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing, it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."
One of the most important features of the Bolt isn\xe2\x80\x99t new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku.
For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.
ow, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".
ot only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.
In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.
nd, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.
In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.
Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.
lso, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.
While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.
I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.
But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.
ure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.

iVo introduces Bolt, a sleek DVR that skips commercials completely
2015-09-30
04:00:03
aking its own flavor of ad blocking to a new level, 
On Tuesday, the company announced a new DVR called TiVo Bolt, a 4K digital video recorder similar to the original TiVo but with extra functionality. These functions include being able to skip entire ad breaks of recorded shows so you can watch recorded shows 30% faster. 
What to stream on HBO, Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix in October
"Using the SkipMode feature on TiVo Bolt, users can press a button and jump through the commercial break, making binging more time-efficient. There's also a QuickMode that lets you move through tedious TV shows like awards program in record speed \xe2\x80\x94 without audio distortion. "
"The TiVo Bolt arrives at a time of piqued interest in both connected devices and commercial avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Rogers, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s President and CEO, said in a statement emailed to 
. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clear demand of consumers is for a TV experience that quickly delivers them exactly what they want the instant they turn on the screen. Bolt is a game-changer that will remind people of how they felt the first time they experienced digital recording."
"The original TiVo gives you universal search functionality through OnePass and this will be available on the Bolt, too. Universal search allows a viewer to search for content regardless of the source \xe2\x80\x94 bringing in shows from cable, on-demand services like Netflix and apps, if they're supported. "
"In a cool extra feature, you can click a button on the TiVo Bolt to make your lost remote control play a song. You also don't need to point the controller at the box, allowing for easier channel-switching. "
iVo Bolt will also provide more personalization features, including recommendations from friends, selections of content from critics, and video related to your interests.
"The new look TiVo is all-white, curved and smooth, which is a move away from the TiVo black boxes of yesteryear. It's also dramatically smaller in size than the previous models, which means you can hide it a little easier in your lounge room. "
iVo Bolt comes in two sizes \xe2\x80\x94 500GB and 1TB, costing US$300 and US$400 respectively, which is keeps the TiVo in quite a high price bracket. It will be available Sept. 30 online at TiVo.com, BestBuy.com and Amazon.com, and in stores from Oct. 4.

On Tuesday, the company announced a new DVR called TiVo Bolt, a 4K digital video recorder similar to the original TiVo but with extra functionality. These functions include being able to skip entire ad breaks of recorded shows so you can watch recorded shows 30% faster. 
What to stream on HBO, Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix in October
"Using the SkipMode feature on TiVo Bolt, users can press a button and jump through the commercial break, making binging more time-efficient. There's also a QuickMode that lets you move through tedious TV shows like awards program in record speed \xe2\x80\x94 without audio distortion. "
"The TiVo Bolt arrives at a time of piqued interest in both connected devices and commercial avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Rogers, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s President and CEO, said in a statement emailed to 
. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clear demand of consumers is for a TV experience that quickly delivers them exactly what they want the instant they turn on the screen. Bolt is a game-changer that will remind people of how they felt the first time they experienced digital recording."
"The original TiVo gives you universal search functionality through OnePass and this will be available on the Bolt, too. Universal search allows a viewer to search for content regardless of the source \xe2\x80\x94 bringing in shows from cable, on-demand services like Netflix and apps, if they're supported. "
"In a cool extra feature, you can click a button on the TiVo Bolt to make your lost remote control play a song. You also don't need to point the controller at the box, allowing for easier channel-switching. "
iVo Bolt will also provide more personalization features, including recommendations from friends, selections of content from critics, and video related to your interests.
"The new look TiVo is all-white, curved and smooth, which is a move away from the TiVo black boxes of yesteryear. It's also dramatically smaller in size than the previous models, which means you can hide it a little easier in your lounge room. "
iVo Bolt comes in two sizes \xe2\x80\x94 500GB and 1TB, costing US$300 and US$400 respectively, which is keeps the TiVo in quite a high price bracket. It will be available Sept. 30 online at TiVo.com, BestBuy.com and Amazon.com, and in stores from Oct. 4.

How to Enable a Hidden Commercial-Skipping Button on Any DV
10/03/13
epending on where you get your DVR, it may or may not have the ability to skip commercials. The best ones have a button that lets you jump forward, but if your DVR was issued by a cable or satellite company, they may have hidden or removed it. Here are some semi-secret ways to do it anyway.
", and we decided to take another look to see if those DVR tweaks and tricks still work. Here's what we found:"
30-Second DVR Tweak Speeds Up Commercial Skipping
VRs have revolutionized the way people watch TV, but if you&apos;ve always wished your DVR were a\xe2\x80\xa6
"If you have a newer Motorola DVR, you can easily program a 30-second skip button that works both on pre-recorded shows and while you're in Cable mode and watching certain live TV events. Here's how to do it, thanks to "
". If you've done it correctly, AUX will blink twice again."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do, the "
"Matt notes that the new 30-second skip button will work in Cable mode as well as for pre-recorded programming. He also notes that if your AUX button was set up to control a receiver or some other device in your entertainment system, you'll need to reprogram it after doing this."
"This method should work for most newer Comcast-issued DVRs, but if you still have one of the older ones with the silver remotes, our old trick should still work. Here's how to do it, if you need a refresher:"
". If you've done it correctly, CABLE will blink twice."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do,the "
"That's all there is to it. Reportedly this works even on Comcast's newest DVR models."
If you have a DirecTV DVR (model HR2X) and remote, your remote may already have a "slip" button on it that will essentially fast forward for 30 seconds. It\'s not the same as actually skipping 30 seconds ahead in one tap, but it probably covers more time. Still, you can customize the behavior of that button so it\'s a "skip" and not a "slip" if you prefer. 
, this is how you do it
Press the red button on your remote. Make sure the 
You may see a message that says "There are no matching programs." That\'s okay.
"Now, the fast forward button will skip forward 30 seconds every time you tap it. Tap the button four or five times when a commercial break starts, and you should be clear of all of the commercials in pretty short order. If you don't like the change and want to undo it, just follow the steps above and use the code "
, and it should go back to normal.
", and point out that it also works on DirecTV HR20-700s, as well as the newer HR2X models, as long as they've been updated recently."
Of course, Dish Network is the home of 
", a new DVR that's specifically designed to make skipping commercials easy, no matter what TV or device you're watching on. The Hopper is the first device to include Dish's new "
", which will alert you ahead of time that it's capable of skipping over commercial breaks in selected programming, and then just do it automatically without you having to lift a finger."
"If you'd rather have control (or you run into programming where Auto Hop doesn't work), you can still skip content yourself\xe2\x80\x94there's likely a 30-second skip button already on your remote. Even if you have an older Dish Network DVR, you probably have a skip button that works for both pre-recorded programming and that works if you've paused live TV, and want to skip any commercials or filler that aired after you hit the pause button."
FIOS TV DVRs also don\'t have a specific "commercial skip" feature, but they do have a built-in 30-second skip and fully-featured fast forward, both of which work on pre-recorded programming and after pausing live TV, but not on Video On Demand programming. However, in some cases if you\'re using FIOS TV\'s multi-room DVR feature and watching recorded programming on a non-DVR box elsewhere in your home, 
". The fast forward button, however, does work wherever you're watching."
iVo won\'t skip commercials specifically, but you can change your skip button into a 30-second skip instead of a "skip to the next part of the show." Our 
"While playing a recorded show, hit select-play-select-3-0-select. You'll hear 3 chimes if you did it right. You'll need to redo this whenever the Tivo reboots."
ow, your "skip" button will skip 30 seconds, not to the next hash mark on your show\'s progress bar. 
Wired reports that this still works too
", and confirms that if your TiVo loses power, gets a software update, or is rebooted, you'll have to repeat the above command to get the 30-second skip functionality back. The skip feature does not work on live TV."
"With luck, there's a skip button or feature for your DVR in the list above, or it already comes with a button that allows you to quickly fast forward or skip 30 seconds at a time without hassle. However, you'll notice we didn't mention some providers, most notably Time Warner, who actually "
going out of their way to stop you from skipping commercials
". To their defense, they say it's because content owners are making them do it, and "
". Regardless of who's to blame, if we couldn't find a method that worked universally for a cable or satellite provider, we didn't include them."
Of course, if you really want full and total control over your pre-recorded programming, your best bet is to either buy your own DVR independent of your TV provider, or 
build one yourself and record your own shows
". Then you're the one in the driver's seat, and you can skip whatever you like."

30-Second DVR Tweak Speeds Up Commercial Skipping
4/23/09
"DVRs have revolutionized the way people watch TV, but if you've always wished your DVR were a little better at skipping commercials, this classic 30-second skip hack is a must."
"For what it's worth, we realize that these tricks aren't new by any means. Still, we've never featured them here, and the aim of this post is to collect as many of them as possible. Right now, we're aware of two hacks of this kind: one for the TiVo, the other for Comcast DVR."

1) Press the "Cable" button at the top of the remote to put it into Cable Box control mode.

\n3) Type in the code 994. The "Cable" button will blink twice.

iVo DVR offers option to skip entire commercial break
Updated on September 30, 2015 at  1:31 PM
Posted on September 30, 2015 at  1:27 PM
\n        \n            This product image provided by TiVo shows the new TiVo Bolt digital video recorder. With one press of a button, the Bolt will skip an entire commercial break when users watch recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours.\n        \n        \n            \n                
W YORK -- TiVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings."
he feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours.
"Satellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompted lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish's commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station."
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney.
"We\'re not changing the underlying content," Denney said in an interview. "We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly."
he TiVo Bolt also has a "quick mode" that plays back recordings 30 percent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\'t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for "How I Met Your Mother" for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
"The TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device's full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo's starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away."
"Wednesday's announcement comes a day after Google Inc. began selling upgrades to its $35 Chromecast video-streaming device. It also launched a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service."
 few weeks ago, Amazon.com Inc. refreshed its streaming-TV devices. The new Fire TV, selling for $100 and shipping next week, will also support 4K video streaming. Apple Inc. is also coming out with an Apple TV update in October.

ish Agrees To Cripple Its Ad-Skipping DVR To Settle Fox Lawsuit
"\nFor years now, broadcasters have waged legal war on Dish network for giving consumers what they want: namely a DVR that automatically skips advertisements users weren't watching anyway. Fox, CBS and NBC Universal all sued Dish "
, claiming that the ad-skipping technology embedded in its "Hopper" DVR violated copyright. Most of the lawsuits were packed with hilariously baseless claims, like Fox ignoring the Betamax case to breathlessly insist that 
merely recording the entire prime time lineup
", with Dish agreeing to hamstring Hopper's skipping functionality in exchange for not only an end to legal hostilities, but access to streaming video rights for its Sling TV service. Fox however continued to push its luck in the courts with "
\nWith the arrival of 2016, however, comes word that Dish and Fox have 
". According to the companies' statement, Dish has, as it did with CBS and Disney, agreed to further cripple its DVR's ad-skipping functionality:"
"Fox Networks Group and Dish Network L.L.C. have reached an agreement resulting in the dismissal of all pending litigation between the two companies, including disputes over Slingbox technology and the AutoHop, PrimeTime Anytime and Transfers features,\xe2\x80\x9d Dish said in the statement. 
"As part of the settlement, Dish\xe2\x80\x99s AutoHop commercial-skipping functionality will not be available for owned and affiliated Fox stations until seven days after a program first airs.\xe2\x80\x9d
"Though it's not indicated by the companies' announcement, the settlement likely also involves some broader access to Fox content for use in Dish's Sling TV service, so the deal's probably not a total evolutionary wash. Still, the end result is one of the most popular and innovative DVRs on the market being crippled just to make legacy broadcast executives feel more comfortable as their empires face earth-shaking disruption on every front.\n"
\nWith the exception of Comcast NBC Universal (which, not coincidentally, directly competes with Dish as a cable provider), all of the original 2012 lawsuits have now been put to bed -- but at the cost of innovation and customer satisfaction.

11:52am
s a result of the settlement, my household will now defer viewing content from owned and affiliated Fox stations until at least eight days after a program first airs. For the sake of advertisers I do not skip (rare, but happens), they had better be using time-insensitive ads.
12:12pm
"I already refuse to watch anything that (at the very least) hasn't been pause long enough to skip commercials. I guess now anything Fox related will be pushed back by 7+ days."
"Or, I guess I can find something to watch that's not all trashed with annoying crap."
o those who will respond with "but, but, the ads pay for the content." First the ads are part of the contend and that part SUUUUUUUUUCKS. Second, risking being the target of someone in a past story, HoneyBlaine don\'t care.
"I'm getting very tired of this line of nonsense. What is now the most valuable public company in the world, (Alphabet), gets the vast majority of it's revenue from simple, unobtrusive, ads that they don't even charge for unless someone clicks. $Billions in revenue from doing ads right."
"You can still skip all the commercials you want. You just have to push the button. It's not that big of a deal. Generally 6 times on the 30 second skip button equals 3 minutes of a normal commercial break. 30 seconds forward, 8 seconds back in general. No waiting days. I generally wait 30 minutes from when a program starts and then play. I don't watch anything LIVE. I don't watch commercials on TV at all."
his really only effect the laziest of people I guess. It will have very little effect. Just a bunch of wasted money going to court over this.
"You can get a TIVO Bolt and it has commercial skip. It's for only a number of channels in a time period. You hit the skip button once and it'll skip them all during that commercial break. There's no waiting days or even hours. To get around the laws, TIVO has real people watching and marking the commercial breaks manually. So you can't watch in the middle of the show and use it, you have to wait a little bit until after it's over and then it works. "
"In general these company's really lost the WAR. To this day people can still record the content and skip on past it. It just can't be automated I guess from the company. Maybe if DISH could do the same thing my VHS player did. Instead of DISH doing the marking of commercials for everyone. Everyone's DVR just did it on it's own. Which in effects gets around the rules. After it's done recording it goes back and marks what it things are the commercials. In fact you could set this up yourself using Windows Media Center and some software which would do exactly that."
12:15pm
his is exactly the kind of bullshit that made me drop any form of broadcast television. I am certainly much happier for it, and have managed to improve my reading rate exponentially.
12:17pm
"Since I don't use Primetime Anytime (because I only watch 4-5 primetime shows on the networks), this affects me ZERO."
You can still manually skip ahead 30 seconds blindly (without viewing commercials).
12:19pm
"And they continue to wonder why people are turning to other sources to get what they want to see. Sorry guys but it's not the 50's anymore, welcome to the 21st century, learn to adapt quickly for once instead of wasting hundreds of millions on stupid and pointless lawsuits."
12:31pm
here isn\'t any evidence that Dish got any sort of CBS content to use on Sling as part of their settlement, and the fact they didn\'t mention it with Fox suggest that didn\'t happen here either. Moreover, ABC still isn\'t on Sling despite ABC supposedly being the reason the Disney networks are on Sling to begin with. I\'m guessing cause and effect might be backwards: Dish wanted ESPN for Sling and Disney said "only if you block AutoHop for ABC shows", which opened the door to reaching the same agreement with CBS and Fox without the Sling agreements.
"Torrented TV shows don't have commercials. All the networks are doing is to make free a totally superior viewing experience to giving them your money."
"I'm glad we dropped Dish and are just using XBMC/Kodi on our main TV. Only payment is for Internet. Currently that's a cable provider with no limits and typically get 17-25Mbps even during primetime. "
"We can watch almost any tv series if it's ever been on and almost any movie, even many of the current ones in theatres without much hassle. Heck, even watching live sports isn't that big of a deal as long as you find a good source."
he Chinese are selling software that will do this in place of the cringing Dish, you can pay for it with your credit card. Not to worry, they already have all of your credit and health care info.
"I'd be pretty pissed off if I was a Dish customer and signed up for a service promising me autoskip...and then they went and bent over for CBS and Fox. I'd probably have to cut down the satellite dish on my roof."
eading article like this makes me feel good about being a cord cuter
"Also, jokes on all of them, i can get any show i want for free with no advertisement, so fuck you big media company's. Enjoy your journey to rock bottom."
"PLEX and a few other pieces of software and you can pretty much watch anything you want commercial free and in HD. TV shows, Movies, all downloaded Automatically without you doing anything. You just go into PLEX and see what's new for you!!!"
"I cut the cord years ago and haven't looked back. I switched from Windows Media Center to TIVO when upgrading my PC to Windows 10. So my TIVO is recording all the broadcast channels in HD and 5.1 surround sound LEGALLY. That 30 second skip button works great. hit it 6 times and that's 3 minutes. Generally enough for a commercial break."
"Ad in Netflix, which is better then ever. Ton's of Content. Lots of great Original programming with a ton more for 2016. Lots and lots of Kids programming. The price is still great and it's all commercial free. With a Antenna and TIVO and Netflix, that takes up most of my viewing time. Plus I have a 800+ Movies on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-Ray. Most of them I've ripped and put on my NAS and then I put my discs into a 300 disc binder as a backup in my closet. Takes up a fraction of the space and I can watch that content using PLEX in any room in my house. No need to dig out a disc. Looks and sounds great. In fact because of PLEX, I can watch any of that content anywhere in the world with a Internet connection on my iPhone for example, or PC, or Airplay to a AppleTV. It's like my own personal Netflix service, but it's all content I like and it doesn't come and go."
"all of the original 2012 lawsuits have now been put to bed -- but at the cost of innovation and customer satisfaction."
"It's not particularly innovative to come up with a way of helping people avoiding paying for stuff - and yes, you pay for network TV by giving up a certain amount of time for commercials. Dish was trying to sell the benefits of network TV with none of the related costs, except of course to their own benefit."
oes the consumer lose out? Sure, a free lunch interrupted is a hell of a price to pay, right? 
o, I pay for it by sending money to Dish. Though not for long.
11:55pm
It\'s precisely this sort of sad, trite logic that has been extended to "if you change the channel or leave your seat to go to the toilet during an ad, it\'s stealing".
But then again, considering your views on police restraint, such a leap of logic is probably par for the course.
Have you considered spreading your wisdom to the masses, that if they do not stay attentive throughout the entire duration of an advertisement, it counts as dollars stolen from corporations? Surely such intellectual epiphany would be widely accepted instead of being treated as utter nonsense, right?
"Wow, what a pile of troll bait. Too bad I won't fall for it."
"It\'s precisely this sort of sad, trite logic that has been extended to "if you change the channel or leave your seat to go to the toilet during an ad, it\'s stealing".
Untrue. My point of discussion is that of a business model, and not your attempt to spin people\'s opinion. The business models is "the TV shows are free, but you must put up with the commercials". Like any situation, if a few people skip over them nobody freaks out. But there is a point where if the numbers get too low, then the value of the ad drops, the income drops, and the shows can\'t be produced (at least not at the same level) as they are now.
" considering your views on police restraint"
"Considering your attempts at trolling and your gross exaggerations of other people's opinions, it's doubtful you have much good to add. Back to sleep troll!"
10:49am
"On the flip side, people skipping the commercials (or, like myself, simply refuse to watch ad-supported TV at all) is just the free market in action. If so many people so it that the shows cannot be sustained in that way, it's just people collectively saying that the shows aren't worth the commercial load."
"^This. None of us is obliged to uphold a business model. If it fails, that's market forces at work. Commercial natural selection, as it were."
"Actually, network execs have made the exact argument that not viewing an ad when its on is tantamount to stealing, derived from the logic you claim isn't. Thanks for playing. Now go back to looking for PaulTs under your bed."
"There you go again, assuming anyone who disagrees with you is a troll. Seriously, you should share your views with the public and see how well they're received."
"By the way, I'm not PaulT, but you'll probably think otherwise."

iVo\'s new Bolt DVR will, as the company puts it, let you "give commercials the finger." 
he device\'s SkipMode feature can bypass entire commercial blocks with the push of a button; no more fast-forwarding. At this point, it will work on select networks during primetime hours; where available, a note on the TV will say "Press to skip and resume show." Participating channels include FX, HGTV, History, Lifetime, NBC, ABC, ABC Family, AMC, Bravo, CBS, Syfy, TBS, TLC, TNT, USA, Comedy Central, The CW, Discovery, Food Network, and Fox. 
QuickMode, meanwhile, lets you watch something 30 percent faster without making those on screen sound like chipmunks. "QuickMode\'s pitch-corrected audio lets you comfortably speed through slow-moving programs like news, sports, and overly long award shows," TiVo said.
"Bolt was designed to meet the requirements of a new generation of TV viewers," Ira Bahr, TiVo\'s chief marketing and retail sales officer, said in a statement.
he Bolt includes universal search, so a search for episodes of

"The device also supports 4K, while the interface got an upgrade:\nupdated design, color, and feel. The DVR's mobile apps, meanwhile, offer recommendations from friends and family, top critics' selection, and the latest videos related to personal hobbies and interests."
 fall update, meanwhile, will lets users create a personalized "What to Watch" screen, and share links to favorite shows on email, Facebook, and Twitter.

ew TiVo DVR will skip through entire commercial break
\t  \n\t\tPublished 10:55  AM ET Wed, 30 Sept 2015\n\t
iVo wants to help you skip TV commercials.
"With one press of a button on the remote, TiVo's new digital video recorder will skip the entire commercial break. That's quicker than the 30-second forward feature found on previous TiVos. On the new TiVo Bolt, TiVo will tag the start and end of commercial breaks so that viewers can skip that section when watching on their recordings. The feature will work with about 20 over-the-air and cable channels, including the major broadcast networks, mostly during prime-time hours."
"Satellite TV provider Dish has had a similar feature on its Hopper DVR, which has prompting lawsuits from several TV channels. Dish has been settling them as part of broader agreements for rights to include the channels on Dish's lineup. In an agreement with CBS, for instance, Dish's commercial-skipping feature is blocked for the first seven days after a program is broadcast on a CBS-owned station."
he San Jose, California, company hopes to avoid legal problems by leaving it to users to enable the feature, said TiVo Inc. Vice President Jim Denney.
"We\'re not changing the underlying content," Denney said in an interview. "We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly."
he TiVo Bolt also has a "quick mode" that plays back recordings 30 percent faster. The pitch on the audio is adjusted using software so that it won\'t sound odd. With this and the commercial skipping, it will be possible to watch an hour-long show in roughly a half-hour.
Other features include support for video in Ultra HD, or 4K, resolution when channels start offering that quality.
s with past models, the TiVo Bolt offers a unified search of both traditional channels and streaming-video services. Ask for "How I Met Your Mother" for reruns on local stations plus video on Netflix. You can watch streaming video such as Hulu on TiVo, but the commercial skipping and quick playback work only with regular recordings. The 4K feature works with both recordings and streaming services that offer it.
"The TiVo Bolt starts at $300 and includes one year of free service, which provides programming data and other information needed to tap the device's full capabilities. After that, service costs $15 a month. TiVo's starting price was cheaper in the past, but people had to pay for monthly service right away."

With the touch of a button, skip to the end of a commercial break and resume watching instantly. Introducing SkipMode.
he SkipMode feature is available only on certain recorded shows; we hope to make it available for the most popular shows on the most popular channels watched by TiVo subscribers. That means you\xe2\x80\x99ll find SkipMode availability on many shows that you record between 4:30 p.m. and midnight (or 12:30 a.m. on major networks) on the most widely-watched channels. \xc2\xa0
When you get to the end of a show segment, press the 
\xc2\xa0button or CHANNEL UP on your remote.
\xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re at the beginning of the next segment, without a commercial in sight.
t any time during the show, CHANNEL UP takes you to the next show segment. For instance, want to skip the judging on your favorite reality show competition (like The Voice or Dancing with the Stars)? Just press CHANNEL UP when the judging starts. You\xe2\x80\x99ll skip past the judging and though the next commercial break. Your show will start playing at the beginning of the next segment.
o skip back to the beginning of a previous show segment, press CHANNEL DOWN.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOf the 40 or so shows we\'ve recorded on our new Bolt, about 10% have the "Skip" feature.
\r\nIs this one of those "read the tiny print" features they use to boost sales of the product?\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt only applies to 20 networks for shows aired between 4:00-12:00.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's limited, but that certainly doesn't make it a scam."
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo be fair, the first presentation of the feature on the Bolt product page is seemingly definitive: "Commercial killer. The only thing more annoying than commercials is having to fast-forward through them every 10 minutes. Now skip over entire commercial breaks at the press of a button."
\nYou have to go one level deeper to see the description of the feature: "The idea of skipping entire commercial breaks at the press of a button has me feeling all tingly inside. How exactly does SkipMode&#8482; work? SkipMode is available when you\'re watching a recorded show. Although not all shows will be available with the SkipMode feature, we\'ve taken great pains to ensure we\'re covering most of the channels that most people in the TiVo community record a lot."
\nThen you have to go one level deeper to get the full story: "The SkipMode feature is available on the top 20 most-watched networks and more channels will be added in the future. The shows that will be SkipMode-enabled are those that appear during the most common recording hours: seven days a week, between the hours of 4:00 pm and midnight (12:30 am for late night talk shows airing on ABC, NBC and CBS)."
\nI think that\'s fair, but arguably they could have made that first presentation say, "Commercial killer. The only thing more annoying than commercials is having to fast-forward through them every 10 minutes. Now skip over entire commercial breaks during prime time on the top twenty networks at the press of a button." There wasn\'t even an asterisk or other indication that there were limitations, in the first presentation of the feature, as they have it now. However, that\'s really picking nits imho.\n\t\t\t\t\t
It only applies to 20 networks for shows aired between 4:00-12:00.
"Even that seems misleading. Since it's really 7pm to midnight Eastern Time. And the 4PM comes from Pacific time.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"Even that seems misleading. Since it's really 7pm to midnight Eastern Time. And the 4PM comes from Pacific time."
"If I'm not mistaken, I believe it is 4pm to midnight Eastern Time (12:30am Eastern Time for the Tonight Show and the Late Show since they run past midnight).\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe point I think Aaron is raising is what is being processed between 4pm and 7pm Eastern Time?\n\t\t\t\t\t
he point I think Aaron is raising is what is being processed between 4pm and 7pm Eastern Time?
s far as I can tell nothing.  They do not do the ABC, CBS, or NBC evening news which is on at 6:30. Does anyone on the East cost actually have shows they record between 4pm & 7pm that have SkipMode enabled?\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI'll double check but I'm pretty certain I have a number of recordings that should have fallen under the 20 channel/time slot and still didn't have commercial skip enabled."
\r\nDoes Skip need to have contact with the Tivo servers at the time of the recording?  My Bolt is constantly doing the spinning icon/Tivo service not available error.
"\r\nAnd it's not a network issue on my side...\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI thought the approach they were using would require access to the TiVo server at time of playback, not at time of recording. Not sure though.\n\t\t\t\t\t
I thought the approach they were using would require access to the TiVo server at time of playback, not at time of recording. Not sure though.
I am guessing the Bolt needs to have a good connection to the TiVo Servers throughout the evening.  SkipMode shows up usually within a few minutes of the end of a show so the data must be being sent throughout the evening.  If someone wants to pull the network connection for a day and then see if SkipMode is enabled after they reconnect please do so and post back the results.\n\t\t\t\t\t
s far as I can tell nothing.  They do not do the ABC, CBS, or NBC evening news which is on at 6:30. Does anyone on the East cost actually have shows they record between 4pm & 7pm that have SkipMode enabled?
I do and none of them have skip. Starting at 7pm on the East Coast I get shows with the Skip function.\n\t\t\t\t\t
s far as I can tell nothing.  They do not do the ABC, CBS, or NBC evening news which is on at 6:30. Does anyone on the East cost actually have shows they record between 4pm & 7pm that have SkipMode enabled?
"They don't do live or local content. The news falls under both. Locally syndicated programming falls under the later. So I think the only thing that would qualify between 4pm and primetime would be nationally syndicated shows. "
\r\nLooking at the schedules for the big 4 networks the only show I see listed as being nationally syndicated is Judge Judy on NBC. Everything else is local programming before 7pm.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've had reruns of Modern Family on the local Fox station between 7pm and 8pm show up with Skip. Although I've only seen a few of them with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I've had reruns of Modern Family on the local Fox station between 7pm and 8pm show up with Skip. Although I've only seen a few of them with it."
"From what I've seen they use a content ID for the episode to generate the skip points, and IIRC Modern Family also plays on USA, so maybe the skip points were generated for USA and just happen to be the same episodes played by your local affiliate. "
\r\nIf that is how it works then this whole thing should get more robust, especially with reruns, over time.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI've seen Skip appear on random channels at random times also... A local independent station has Skip on many old Judge Judy reruns, but the major Fox affiliate with new episodes doesn't. Go figure. Those tags must be getting repurposed."
"\nBut basically anything that isn't part of a national schedule is going to get hosed."
"\nI don't know what the excuse is for the hit and miss of national stations like TBS, Comedy Central, and others though. Does Tivo only watch a show once, and if the markers don't line up (due to speeding up the video or whatever) they just ignore it?\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I don't know what the excuse is for the hit and miss of national stations like TBS, Comedy Central, and others though. Does Tivo only watch a show once, and if the markers don't line up they ignore it?"
From what I can tell they use two lists. One is a segment list with each segment of the show expressed as a start and end point aligned to some clock that is specific to the machine that recorded the episode they used to mark those points. The second list is a hash of all the captions in the recording aligned to that same clock. 
"\nMy assumption as to how it works is that while the episode is being recorded your TiVo hashes the captions using the same algorithm. They then try to match those hashes to the hashes in the list sent with the cut data. If they match then they use their positions to offset the segments in the data to match the timecodes of your recording. I'm not 100% sure if they do it for each segment individually, allowing for different commercial lengths between broadcasters, or if they require a match across the entire show and if one segment doesn't line up they just drop the data completely. Based on the inconsistency some are seeing I'd guess the later.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"They don't do live or local content. The news falls under both. Locally syndicated programming falls under the later. So I think the only thing that would qualify between 4pm and primetime would be nationally syndicated shows. "
\r\nLooking at the schedules for the big 4 networks the only show I see listed as being nationally syndicated is Judge Judy on NBC. Everything else is local programming before 7pm.
"I guess the National news might be live but I don't see how it is local.  Do they actually do separate broadcasts for the east & west costs?  I thought it was just repeated at the correct local time.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"I guess the National news might be live but I don't see how it is local.  Do they actually do separate broadcasts for the east & west costs?  I thought it was just repeated at the correct local time."
"I was thinking local news. But yeah even the national news is live, so that's probably why it's not included."
"\nThe reason they probably don't do live.... captioning in live feeds is inconsistent and typically replaced by real captions on subsequent airings. If they are using the captioning data to align the segments, as I suspect they are, then this would effect that.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt seems skip isn't ready for prime time. Tivo almost comes off desperate by pushing it so hard yet not delivering consistently."
\r\nThey are trying to be Apple so hard, without the chops, and it is resulting in more hype than substance.\n\t\t\t\t\t

iVo finally tells TV broadcasters to stuff it
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
lmost from its inception, TiVo, the San Jose company whose device has given the generic name to\xc2\xa0digital video recorders, has had an uneasy relationship with the broadcasting industry. But with the release last week of a new model of TiVo recorder dubbed the Bolt, the firm is encouraging customers to 
\xc2\xa0in its indelicate words. This is a big change from the past.\xc2\xa0
"A quick look at the history of TiVo. By\xc2\xa0allowing viewers to fast-forward through commercials (not to mention the dull stretches of\xc2\xa0TV programs), devices like TiVo's threatened the very principle of advertising-supported TV."
"TiVo and its original competitor, ReplayTV--both introduced their products in 1999--took different approaches to this option. Through a button on the Replay remote, you could skip commercials entirely, 30 seconds\xc2\xa0at a time. Broadcasters hated that. TiVo took a kinder, gentler approach: You could fast-forward, but not skip. That meant that you would still be exposed to the commercials, albeit\xc2\xa0at turbo-speed. That mollified broadcasters and advertisers somewhat, and it fed into the company's strategy of reaching lucrative cooperative agreements with the networks.\xc2\xa0"
It was a combination of accepting reality (fast-forward was a functionality that\xc2\xa0TiVo buyers demanded) and leaving broadcasters with at least a crumb of outreach to viewers. It may not have detracted much from the DVR experience, which was as compelling as a thunderclap.
\xc2\xa0that during all the years when\xc2\xa0high-tech entrepreneurs would march\xc2\xa0through The Times offices showing off their innovative products, only once did I ever see one that made me think, "This will change my life." It was the\xc2\xa0ReplayTV box, and its potential for completely changing the TV viewing experience was instantly apparent.
"There just aren't enough of you to sustain the company's retail business alone."
\xe2\x80\x94 TiVo executive Ira Bahr to a forum of TiVo enthusiasts
"TiVo's strategy of cozying up to broadcasters, which included offering promotional space on the TiVo box to be pushed at users, enabled the firm to outlast ReplayTV, which\xc2\xa0finally disappeared after several ownership changes.\xc2\xa0But it hasn't yielded consistent profitability--TiVo didn't report\xc2\xa0its first annual profit until 2009, and it has lost money\xc2\xa0in six\xc2\xa0of its last 10\xc2\xa0fiscal years."
"So here comes the Bolt. The serpentine-shaped unit, which will sell for up to $400 with a one-year programming subscription included, offers two new features. One is Skip Mode, a return to the ReplayTV past, which allows users to skip entire commercial breaks at the press of a button. The other is Quick Mode, which allows playback of recorded shows 30% faster, with the audio electronically tweaked so the actors don't all sound like quacking ducks. (Broadcasters might\xc2\xa0not care about that, though content producers might hate it.)"
"Skip Mode is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that the heyday of interpolated broadcast TV commercials is over. It's also a sign of TiVo's new strategy, which\xc2\xa0is to appeal to cord-cutting viewers who get more of their video from subscription sources without commercials, such as Netflix, HBO Now\xc2\xa0and Amazon Prime. Even so, "
\xc2\xa0only for shows on the most popular\xc2\xa020 networks or so, and for shows airing between 4 p.m. and midnight.
"The Bolt itself is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that TiVo's overall business model--selling full-featured DVRs for up to $600 and charging annual subscription fees of $150--is tapped out. Subscriptions are stagnating, and the set-top boxes rented to customers by cable and satellite systems typically incorporate their own DVRs."
iVo added 150,000 subscriptions last year, its chief marketing officer, Ira Bahr, told 
an online forum of loyal TiVo customers
\xc2\xa0last week. "There just aren\'t enough of you to sustain the company\xe2\x80\x99s retail business alone," he said. "Compare that to the millions of streamers out there, and the tens of millions of DVRs out there,\xc2\xa0and you see that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of ground to make up."\xc2\xa0
Whether TiVo will survive the continued evolution of TV is anyone\'s guess. It was successful at upending the business model of broadcasting and cable, but it hasn\'t been the victor in the free-for-all that followed. It\'s still fighting for its life--if it can\'t expand its market, Bahr said, "we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to do much of anything."
s streaming video takes over, the DVR record-at-home model may vanish, too; the box streaming your\xc2\xa0Netflix or Amazon Prime choices\xc2\xa0has no moving parts to break down, and of course no commercials to skip.

iVo Bolt Will Let You Skip An Entire Commercial Break For $300
NL Host Kumail Nanjiani Searches for Studio 8H
iVo BOLT could be the death of commercials, or the death of the entire television industry as we know it perhaps. The TV add-on can totally detect commercials and block them on television show replays.
"The latest edition of TiVo is an unconventional entertainment tool. Classifying itself as a unified entertainment system, the device brings together the user's favorite TV shows, movies and music in a way that's simple, speedy and personal."
"Our goal is to deliver sophisticated, modern devices that will continue to breathe new life into this brand," Ira Bahr, the company\'s chief marketing officer, 
\xc2\xa0in an online forum. "This, as well as the updated branding, is also a nod to a new and refreshed direction for the consumer part of our company."
"\xc2\xa0with the user's cable service or HD antenna to record up to four shows simultaneously. The device automatically detects the start and end of the commercial break and can block the part."
he gadget also delivers the same experience for streaming apps such as Yahoo Screen, Spotify, Pandora, iHeart Radio, Plex and Spotify.
he viewer may browse through the flicks in a click to find the array of seasons of every available episode. By pressing a green button, the user may block commercials.
But commercials are the lifeblood of the entertainment industry, so TiVo is facing complaints from a number of establishments in several places.
ccording to TiVo Vice President Jim Denney, TiVo does not change the underlying content of the material from the television show.
"We\'re not auto-eliminating commercials. The user does it. We\'re giving users a tool to get through their content more quickly," Jim Denney

"Review: TiVo's latest model makes it easier to bolt from cable"
\n                      September 30, 2016 \n                      by Jim Rossman, The Dallas Morning News\n                      \n                  
"The first thing you'll notice about the TiVo Bolt is its odd shape - it looks like someone bent the case in an industrial press.\n                                "
"In a call with the Bolt's product manager, I asked why the case was not level. I said it wouldn't play nice in my home theater cabinet because it would be difficult to stack other components on top of it."

"Channel Master DVR+ review: Over-the-air recording that's a bit too basic"
iVo Bolt Vox DVR review: New look, same old app problem
iVo Roamio OTA review: This DVR would be a cord-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s dream machine, if...
If you want to ditch cable without losing the cable DVR experience\xe2\x80\x94warts and all\xe2\x80\x94the TiVo Roamio OTA is your answer.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s $400 DVR for over-the-air channels has all the creature comforts of a cable box, from the traditional channel grid and button-packed remote control to the seemingly limitless recording options for TV shows and movies. And like TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s own cable boxes, it comes with some powerful ad-skipping features.
But TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old-school approach to recording broadcasts from an antenna also brings some baggage. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get lost in the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s labyrinthine menus, or forget what button you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to press. And while TiVo tries to be a complete cord-cutting solution with both over-the-air and streaming video, its options for the latter can\xe2\x80\x99t compete with dedicated streaming boxes like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Nvidia Shield TV.
he TiVo Roamio OTA is a hulking piece of creaky plastic, more like a cable box than a modern streaming device. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s an HDMI output, an optical audio jack for connecting to older sound systems, and, quizzically, a couple USB ports whose only purpose is to charge other devices (external USB storage is not supported). You supply your own antenna, which plugs into the Roamio OTA\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial input.
"If you want to expand the Roamio OTA's storage, you'll need to replace its existing internal drive. The USB ports are only good for charging devices and the only compatible e-SATA drive was discontinued."
Inside, the box has 1TB of storage\xe2\x80\x94good for about 150 hours of HD programming\xe2\x80\x94and four tuners, so you can watch or record four programs at once. The internal drive is replaceable, but while the Roamio OTA technically allows external storage via a rear e-SATA port, the only supported drive is WD\xe2\x80\x99s DVR Extender, which is no longer manufactured or sold.
qually cable-like is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s remote control, a hefty implement with more than 40 buttons for changing channels, controlling the TV, controlling playback, and navigating through the TiVo Guide. Having almost every conceivable function just a button press away makes some sense, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to create whiplash for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s used to streaming remotes, with their minimalist designs, contextual on-screen menus, and voice search.
he remote does, however, have some welcome departures from cable boxes: It uses an RF signal to control the TiVo\xe2\x80\x94no line-of-sight required\xe2\x80\x94but still includes an IR blaster for your television\xe2\x80\x99s volume, power, and input. Best of all, it lets you easily skip advertisements. Pressing up or the green \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button during commercials automatically takes you to the end of the break on certain programs, and there\xe2\x80\x99s also a dedicated button for jumping ahead by 30 seconds.
"TiVo's remote is loaded with buttons. On the bright side, it has both RF and infrared transmitters."
iVo used to charge for DVR service, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the $400 price. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to pay up front, but in the long run it beats paying TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s old $15-per-month service charge.
In terms of raw capabilities, the TiVo Roamio OTA offers an impressive amount of granular controls. When setting up a series recording\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cOnePass\xe2\x80\x9d in TiVo lingo\xe2\x80\x94you can record just new airings, limit recordings to a specific channel, record in HD only, record in SD only, keep only recent recordings, keep recordings only until you run out space, and add buffer time on either end of the recording. Through TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWishList\xe2\x80\x9d section, you can even program recordings for a specific actor, director, category, or keyword.
iVo also pulls TV episodes from various streaming services into OnePass, so if a show is on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu, it\xe2\x80\x99ll show up in the same list as your over-the-air recordings. The feature will likely be most beneficial to Hulu subscribers, given that service\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on network television. With Netflix and Amazon, you may find that there\xe2\x80\x99s not much overlap between recorded and streaming series.
"TiVo's channel guide offers impressively granular control over what you want to watch now and record for later."
Use TiVo enough, and the system will even start automatically recording programs that it thinks you\xe2\x80\x99ll like. You\xe2\x80\x99re still in charge of fine-tuning the suggestion algorithms by giving thumbs up or down to whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re watching, but being able to populate the DVR without programming everything manually is a nice way to feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth.
Where TiVo falters is in helping users make sense of its many features. The TiVo Roamio OTA is overwrought with menus that are redundant or of dubious utility, including two separate menus for launching apps, two areas for browsing live TV, and a recommendations row on the main menu that rarely seems relevant. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a menu full of curated movie and TV show \xe2\x80\x9ccollections,\xe2\x80\x9d but TiVo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t label the sources for this content up front, and in many cases the selections are only for rental or purchase.
he whole interface could use a complete overhaul. One is supposedly 
, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see how that redesign works on a day-to-day basis.
iVo\'s curated "collections" don\'t indicate where the content is coming from, so you won\'t know if it\'s included in a service you already have or if you\'ll need to pay more to access it.
hose issues aside, the TiVo Roamio OTA is also missing some benefits you\xe2\x80\x99d get with other over-the-air DVR solutions.
Its app selection, for instance, is dismal compared to dedicated streaming boxes. New streaming bundles such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, and DirecTV Now are absent, and the only TV Everywhere apps are HBO Go and Epix. New streaming services like SeeSo, Pluto.TV, and Filmstruck aren\xe2\x80\x99t available either. The apps that do exist also seem slower than their streaming box counterparts, especially those that come from the Opera TV app store. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect TiVo to serve all your streaming needs unless they\xe2\x80\x99re fairly basic.
nd unlike OTA DVR products from Tablo, HDHomeRun, and Plex, TiVo can\xe2\x80\x99t stream your recordings onto other connected devices, at least not without additional hardware. Watching TV on your phone or tablet requires a $130 TiVo Stream box, and watching on other televisions requires a 
, raising the cost considerably if you want a whole-home or out-of-home solution.
he TiVo Roamio OTA is still worthwhile for folks who want a powerful DVR solution, but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the vagaries of streaming. With four tuners, ample recording options, and helpful ad-skipping features, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s over-the-air DVR excels at squeezing every bit of value out of your antenna signal. It\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to shake the feeling that its best days are behind it.

he Secret Method to Skip Commercials with One Button on Your DV
10/03/13
"DVRs have made all our lives better, that's a verifiable fact. But fast forwarding through our DVRs is an inexact science, sometimes we skip too far and have to slowly rewind with awkward button combinations. Other times we're too fearful of faster forwarding that we cut it off with too much left to go. No worries. Lifehacker put together a list of ways to create a secret automatic commercial-skipping button on your DVR. Clean."
How to Enable a Hidden Commercial-Skipping Button on Any DV
10/03/13
epending on where you get your DVR, it may or may not have the ability to skip commercials. The best ones have a button that lets you jump forward, but if your DVR was issued by a cable or satellite company, they may have hidden or removed it. Here are some semi-secret ways to do it anyway.
", and we decided to take another look to see if those DVR tweaks and tricks still work. Here's what we found:"
30-Second DVR Tweak Speeds Up Commercial Skipping
VRs have revolutionized the way people watch TV, but if you&apos;ve always wished your DVR were a\xe2\x80\xa6
"If you have a newer Motorola DVR, you can easily program a 30-second skip button that works both on pre-recorded shows and while you're in Cable mode and watching certain live TV events. Here's how to do it, thanks to "
". If you've done it correctly, AUX will blink twice again."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do, the "
"Matt notes that the new 30-second skip button will work in Cable mode as well as for pre-recorded programming. He also notes that if your AUX button was set up to control a receiver or some other device in your entertainment system, you'll need to reprogram it after doing this."
"This method should work for most newer Comcast-issued DVRs, but if you still have one of the older ones with the silver remotes, our old trick should still work. Here's how to do it, if you need a refresher:"
". If you've done it correctly, CABLE will blink twice."
"Now press the button you want to be the 30-second skip button. Make sure it's a button that doesn't have another use that you use regularly. When you do,the "
"That's all there is to it. Reportedly this works even on Comcast's newest DVR models."
If you have a DirecTV DVR (model HR2X) and remote, your remote may already have a "slip" button on it that will essentially fast forward for 30 seconds. It\'s not the same as actually skipping 30 seconds ahead in one tap, but it probably covers more time. Still, you can customize the behavior of that button so it\'s a "skip" and not a "slip" if you prefer. 
, this is how you do it
Press the red button on your remote. Make sure the 
You may see a message that says "There are no matching programs." That\'s okay.
"Now, the fast forward button will skip forward 30 seconds every time you tap it. Tap the button four or five times when a commercial break starts, and you should be clear of all of the commercials in pretty short order. If you don't like the change and want to undo it, just follow the steps above and use the code "
, and it should go back to normal.
", and point out that it also works on DirecTV HR20-700s, as well as the newer HR2X models, as long as they've been updated recently."
Of course, Dish Network is the home of 
", a new DVR that's specifically designed to make skipping commercials easy, no matter what TV or device you're watching on. The Hopper is the first device to include Dish's new "
", which will alert you ahead of time that it's capable of skipping over commercial breaks in selected programming, and then just do it automatically without you having to lift a finger."
"If you'd rather have control (or you run into programming where Auto Hop doesn't work), you can still skip content yourself\xe2\x80\x94there's likely a 30-second skip button already on your remote. Even if you have an older Dish Network DVR, you probably have a skip button that works for both pre-recorded programming and that works if you've paused live TV, and want to skip any commercials or filler that aired after you hit the pause button."
FIOS TV DVRs also don\'t have a specific "commercial skip" feature, but they do have a built-in 30-second skip and fully-featured fast forward, both of which work on pre-recorded programming and after pausing live TV, but not on Video On Demand programming. However, in some cases if you\'re using FIOS TV\'s multi-room DVR feature and watching recorded programming on a non-DVR box elsewhere in your home, 
". The fast forward button, however, does work wherever you're watching."
iVo won\'t skip commercials specifically, but you can change your skip button into a 30-second skip instead of a "skip to the next part of the show." Our 
"While playing a recorded show, hit select-play-select-3-0-select. You'll hear 3 chimes if you did it right. You'll need to redo this whenever the Tivo reboots."
ow, your "skip" button will skip 30 seconds, not to the next hash mark on your show\'s progress bar. 
Wired reports that this still works too
", and confirms that if your TiVo loses power, gets a software update, or is rebooted, you'll have to repeat the above command to get the 30-second skip functionality back. The skip feature does not work on live TV."
"With luck, there's a skip button or feature for your DVR in the list above, or it already comes with a button that allows you to quickly fast forward or skip 30 seconds at a time without hassle. However, you'll notice we didn't mention some providers, most notably Time Warner, who actually "
going out of their way to stop you from skipping commercials
". To their defense, they say it's because content owners are making them do it, and "
". Regardless of who's to blame, if we couldn't find a method that worked universally for a cable or satellite provider, we didn't include them."
Of course, if you really want full and total control over your pre-recorded programming, your best bet is to either buy your own DVR independent of your TV provider, or 
build one yourself and record your own shows
". Then you're the one in the driver's seat, and you can skip whatever you like."

iVo introduces Bolt, a sleek DVR that skips commercials completely
2015-09-30
04:00:03
aking its own flavor of ad blocking to a new level, 
On Tuesday, the company announced a new DVR called TiVo Bolt, a 4K digital video recorder similar to the original TiVo but with extra functionality. These functions include being able to skip entire ad breaks of recorded shows so you can watch recorded shows 30% faster. 
What to stream on HBO, Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix in October
"Using the SkipMode feature on TiVo Bolt, users can press a button and jump through the commercial break, making binging more time-efficient. There's also a QuickMode that lets you move through tedious TV shows like awards program in record speed \xe2\x80\x94 without audio distortion. "
"The TiVo Bolt arrives at a time of piqued interest in both connected devices and commercial avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Rogers, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s President and CEO, said in a statement emailed to 
. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clear demand of consumers is for a TV experience that quickly delivers them exactly what they want the instant they turn on the screen. Bolt is a game-changer that will remind people of how they felt the first time they experienced digital recording."
"The original TiVo gives you universal search functionality through OnePass and this will be available on the Bolt, too. Universal search allows a viewer to search for content regardless of the source \xe2\x80\x94 bringing in shows from cable, on-demand services like Netflix and apps, if they're supported. "
"In a cool extra feature, you can click a button on the TiVo Bolt to make your lost remote control play a song. You also don't need to point the controller at the box, allowing for easier channel-switching. "
iVo Bolt will also provide more personalization features, including recommendations from friends, selections of content from critics, and video related to your interests.
"The new look TiVo is all-white, curved and smooth, which is a move away from the TiVo black boxes of yesteryear. It's also dramatically smaller in size than the previous models, which means you can hide it a little easier in your lounge room. "
iVo Bolt comes in two sizes \xe2\x80\x94 500GB and 1TB, costing US$300 and US$400 respectively, which is keeps the TiVo in quite a high price bracket. It will be available Sept. 30 online at TiVo.com, BestBuy.com and Amazon.com, and in stores from Oct. 4.

Love watching TV shows without commercials? Then you might be interested in the new TiVo Bolt, an all-in-one DVR with a mode that lets you 
In fact, the new player seems to be all about speed. Not only does it rocket you through commercials\xe2\x80\x94one at a time or an entire block\xe2\x80\x94using SkipMode, it also has an innovative QuickMode, which the company claims wisks you through recorded shows up to 30 percent faster without causing any audio sync issues. Imagine watching a replay of the Academy Awards, for example, in less than three hours\xe2\x80\x94all without missing a word.
"SkipMode doesn't work with sports\xe2\x80\x94so you'll have to live with beer ads\xe2\x80\x94but QuickMode can speed up the action during play lags."
Like other TiVo models, the distinctively angled Bolt box offers multiple sources of content\xe2\x80\x94cable, video on demand, over-the air (via an antenna) broadcasts, and streaming\xe2\x80\x94with universal search capability. It can also record up to four shows at once. And its HDMI 2.0 output makes this the first TiVo to support 4K video content.
"The SkipMode ad feature frees you from repeatedly hitting a 30-second skip button or futilely trying to pull your finger off the fast-forward button precisely at commercial's end. For now, though, it's somewhat limited. It only works with recorded programs from specific providers\xe2\x80\x94TiVo says that includes the top 20 most-watched networks\xe2\x80\x94and (unlike QuickMode) it's not offered at all on sports programs. To see if a show is skip-enabled, look in your My Shows folder, where titles will be listed with skip icons beside them."
Let us know what you think of the new TiVo Bolt in the comments section below
"The TiVo Bolt will start appearing in stores October 4th. It's already available online at TiVo, Amazon, and Best Buy. It comes in two flavors: The 500GB hard drive model costs $300 and the 1TB version is priced at $400. Both include one year of TiVo service, which currently costs $150."
iVo says it will offer a few updates this fall, including the ability to create a personalized "what to watch" screen based on your hobbies and interests, and a social sharing feature that provides links so your friends can watch the same show as you.
"The TiVo Bolt replaces the basic TiVo Roamio model in the company's lineup, but the other "

In comparison to the Roamio DVRs, however, the Bolt has a faster processor, improved Wi-Fi (it supports 802.11AC), and more memory, so we imagine it will operate more quickly. If you decide to get a TiVo Bolt, let us know what you think of it, and how well the commercial skip feature works.

Mossberg: TiVo Bolt Review: Watching TV Faster
kip commercials with one click, and speed up the rest of the show, too.
Welcome to Mossberg, a new weekly commentary and reviews column on 
Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that "TiVo has no commercial-skipping button" and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make good business sense."
It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.
nd the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. "SkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant," TiVo now boasts.
Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.
In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.
nd that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.
he latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock."
till, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.
he Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.
Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.
But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)
Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.
iVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.
o make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing, it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."
One of the most important features of the Bolt isn\xe2\x80\x99t new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku.
For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.
ow, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".
ot only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.
In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.
nd, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.
In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.
Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.
lso, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.
While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.
I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.
But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.
ure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.

iVo is back with an all new DVR: TiVo Bolt! More of a side-grade than an upgrade from the TiVo Roamio Plus and Roamio Pro, the TiVo Bolt is the first TiVo DVR to offer 4K UHD resolution. You can currently stream content from both Netflix and YouTube in 4K, with more to come soon (hopefully Amazon!)
he two other major features of the TiVo Bolt are QuickMode and SkipMode. With SkipMode, TiVo allows you to completely skip over blocks of commercials with the press of a button for prime time shows that air on the top 20 TV networks. QuickMode allows you to speed up your TV watching, playing the content at 1.3x the normal speed. Voices still sound as they should, but the show just plays a little faster, allowing you to get through them quicker.
he shape of the box is a bit odd, and the two-tone black and white remote is a departure as well, but the Bolt is faster and more responsive than any previous model. It can also record up to four shows at once.

iVo finally tells TV broadcasters to stuff it
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
"TiVo's new Bolt: Will it leave broadcasters bent out of shape?"
lmost from its inception, TiVo, the San Jose company whose device has given the generic name to\xc2\xa0digital video recorders, has had an uneasy relationship with the broadcasting industry. But with the release last week of a new model of TiVo recorder dubbed the Bolt, the firm is encouraging customers to 
\xc2\xa0in its indelicate words. This is a big change from the past.\xc2\xa0
"A quick look at the history of TiVo. By\xc2\xa0allowing viewers to fast-forward through commercials (not to mention the dull stretches of\xc2\xa0TV programs), devices like TiVo's threatened the very principle of advertising-supported TV."
"TiVo and its original competitor, ReplayTV--both introduced their products in 1999--took different approaches to this option. Through a button on the Replay remote, you could skip commercials entirely, 30 seconds\xc2\xa0at a time. Broadcasters hated that. TiVo took a kinder, gentler approach: You could fast-forward, but not skip. That meant that you would still be exposed to the commercials, albeit\xc2\xa0at turbo-speed. That mollified broadcasters and advertisers somewhat, and it fed into the company's strategy of reaching lucrative cooperative agreements with the networks.\xc2\xa0"
It was a combination of accepting reality (fast-forward was a functionality that\xc2\xa0TiVo buyers demanded) and leaving broadcasters with at least a crumb of outreach to viewers. It may not have detracted much from the DVR experience, which was as compelling as a thunderclap.
\xc2\xa0that during all the years when\xc2\xa0high-tech entrepreneurs would march\xc2\xa0through The Times offices showing off their innovative products, only once did I ever see one that made me think, "This will change my life." It was the\xc2\xa0ReplayTV box, and its potential for completely changing the TV viewing experience was instantly apparent.
"There just aren't enough of you to sustain the company's retail business alone."
\xe2\x80\x94 TiVo executive Ira Bahr to a forum of TiVo enthusiasts
"TiVo's strategy of cozying up to broadcasters, which included offering promotional space on the TiVo box to be pushed at users, enabled the firm to outlast ReplayTV, which\xc2\xa0finally disappeared after several ownership changes.\xc2\xa0But it hasn't yielded consistent profitability--TiVo didn't report\xc2\xa0its first annual profit until 2009, and it has lost money\xc2\xa0in six\xc2\xa0of its last 10\xc2\xa0fiscal years."
"So here comes the Bolt. The serpentine-shaped unit, which will sell for up to $400 with a one-year programming subscription included, offers two new features. One is Skip Mode, a return to the ReplayTV past, which allows users to skip entire commercial breaks at the press of a button. The other is Quick Mode, which allows playback of recorded shows 30% faster, with the audio electronically tweaked so the actors don't all sound like quacking ducks. (Broadcasters might\xc2\xa0not care about that, though content producers might hate it.)"
"Skip Mode is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that the heyday of interpolated broadcast TV commercials is over. It's also a sign of TiVo's new strategy, which\xc2\xa0is to appeal to cord-cutting viewers who get more of their video from subscription sources without commercials, such as Netflix, HBO Now\xc2\xa0and Amazon Prime. Even so, "
\xc2\xa0only for shows on the most popular\xc2\xa020 networks or so, and for shows airing between 4 p.m. and midnight.
"The Bolt itself is an acknowledgment\xc2\xa0that TiVo's overall business model--selling full-featured DVRs for up to $600 and charging annual subscription fees of $150--is tapped out. Subscriptions are stagnating, and the set-top boxes rented to customers by cable and satellite systems typically incorporate their own DVRs."
iVo added 150,000 subscriptions last year, its chief marketing officer, Ira Bahr, told 
an online forum of loyal TiVo customers
\xc2\xa0last week. "There just aren\'t enough of you to sustain the company\xe2\x80\x99s retail business alone," he said. "Compare that to the millions of streamers out there, and the tens of millions of DVRs out there,\xc2\xa0and you see that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of ground to make up."\xc2\xa0
Whether TiVo will survive the continued evolution of TV is anyone\'s guess.

iVo\'s new Bolt DVR will, as the company puts it, let you "give commercials the finger." 
he device\'s SkipMode feature can bypass entire commercial blocks with the push of a button; no more fast-forwarding. At this point, it will work on select networks during primetime hours; where available, a note on the TV will say "Press to skip and resume show." Participating channels include FX, HGTV, History, Lifetime, NBC, ABC, ABC Family, AMC, Bravo, CBS, Syfy, TBS, TLC, TNT, USA, Comedy Central, The CW, Discovery, Food Network, and Fox. 
QuickMode, meanwhile, lets you watch something 30 percent faster without making those on screen sound like chipmunks. "QuickMode\'s pitch-corrected audio lets you comfortably speed through slow-moving programs like news, sports, and overly long award shows," TiVo said.
"Bolt was designed to meet the requirements of a new generation of TV viewers," Ira Bahr, TiVo\'s chief marketing and retail sales officer, said in a statement.

"The device also supports 4K, while the interface got an upgrade:\nupdated design, color, and feel. The DVR's mobile apps, meanwhile, offer recommendations from friends and family, top critics' selection, and the latest videos related to personal hobbies and interests."
 fall update, meanwhile, will lets users create a personalized "What to Watch" screen, and share links to favorite shows on email, Facebook, and Twitter.
vailable today online from TiVo, Best Buy, and Amazon, choose from the 500GB model for $299.99 or the 1000GB version for $399.99; both require the TiVo service, which is currently $149.99 per year. Starting Oct. 4, the set-top box will hit brick-and-mortar stores, including Best Buy, Magnolia Home Theater, and Magnolia Design Centers.

iVo Bolt Adds Smart Commercial Skips, Speed-Watching
iVo Bolt Adds Smart Commercial Skips, Speed-Watching
iVo is certainly facing competition these days, with set-top boxes, TVs and consoles all offering a variety of smart and/or 
, introduces a couple new features that show TiVo still has gas in the tank, even with new Apple TVs and other inventions on the horizon.
he TiVo Bolt is\xe2\x80\xa6odd-looking. It has a strange, warped appearance that may have looked cool in concept but gives it a half-baked appearance as a final product. But once set up, the fun begis: This set top box can handle a lot of basic DVRing features, but its big news is a couple new abilities.
First, Bolt uses SkipMode to automatically and smartly skip commercials seamlessly, a feature that consumers have wanted pretty much before the TiVo even existed. Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new QuickMode feature that speeds things up by around 30%, but keeps voices smooth and low so you can listen without being irritated by the chipmunks. TiVo hints that this will be handy when catching up on DVRed sports games.
Other, more ordinary features include notable 4K support for the latest resolutions, OneSearch to search for shows immediately across all apps and channels, access to web apps and variety of smart streaming services, and up to 4 simultaneous recordings at once. There\xe2\x80\x99s a choice between 500 and 1,000GB TiVo Bolts.
he new features are welcome, but it comes back to what we have said about TiVos before. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t already have one, there are plenty devices that can take their place, including an 
, an Apple TV, A Roku, and other various consoles, 
, and cable boxes. But if saving a lot of shows at once is important, of it you already have a TiVo, then the Bolt may be a must-buy. Those new features add more value to DVRing than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in quite a while.
Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s also the price. The Bolt costs around $300, pretty high for a cable box, although that does include a year of TiVo service. The 1,000GB version costs $400 if you want the upgrade.

Bolt Review from a first time Tivo owner/cordcutter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
"\r\nFrom a pure DVR perspective, the Bolt is far and away the best DVR I've seen. Tivo has put its many years in the DVR business to good use, refining functionality into a sophisticated product that remains simple to use and is highly reliable. Some of the items which jump out at me:"
\r\n1) The quality of the guide data is the best in the business. I don\'t know whether Tivo builds or buys its guide data, but it\'s comprehensive, current, and seemingly designed for DVR usage. One example: Where Microsoft\'s data often had "Teams to be announced" on Sunday NFL games, Tivo always has the actual game description (e.g. "Kirk Cousins and the Washington Redskins take on Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears"). Sports events are categorized at incredibly granular levels so you can, for example, \'Record all indoor soccer\' events. Quality guide data translates to desired recordings not being missed.
"\r\n2) The device itself is rock-solid. In six weeks of use it's never frozen, missed an expected recording, or otherwise acted up."
\r\n3) The "wishlist" search capability is incredible. It has boolean logic! e.g. "Record any show with a description mentioning \'Jackson\' that also mentions (\'Michael\' or \'Five\') but NOT if it mentions \'Bo\' ".
\r\n4) "Quickmode", where shows are played back 30% faster than normal is golden for sports. Watching a three hour football game in two hours means more time with the family. Outside of sports, it often feels too fast. A "user selectable" quickmode speed (30% for sports, 15% for drama?) would make this feature even more useful.
\r\n5) "Skipmode," where select primetime shows have semi-automated commercial skipping , works fairly well on the shows where it\'s available.  See below for some (negative) thoughts on Skipmode.
"\r\n6) The initial setup of the device is painfully slow (1-2 hours), but after that, the system is highly responsive in day-to-day use and you're never left waiting for something to process/complete. This was true even before I upgraded to an SSD."
\r\n7) The inclusion of a 3.5mm audio port makes it possible to use traditional (non-bluetooth) wireless headphones with the device (thank you Tivo!). There is an optical audio port as well (something Apple has abandoned).
\r\n8) The famous Tivo "30-second-skip" button works well for moving past commercials. Since most commercial breaks are about three minutes, I wish there was an additional button targeted at skipping that longer length.
\r\n9) The iOS experience--where available (see below)--is very impressive. Live TV streams almost flawlessly. The "30 second skip" Tivo button is available. Searching for and scheduling recordings is delightful. Best of all, you can download content for offline viewing (road trip with the kids!).
"\r\n10) 4k support increases the future-proofing of the device to some extent. Obviously there is no OTA 4k material, so you're limited to 4k streaming (e.g. Netflix)."
\r\n11) Web-based viewing of live/recorded shows from a computer is available at online.tivo.com.
\r\n12) The Tivo can be controlled by a digital remote "app" on your smartphone/tablet or even windows PC. The Bolt also has a "remote finder" button on the back of the device which makes the physical remote start beeping when it\'s lost under the couch.
"\r\n13) Four tuners ensures you'll never have a tuner conflict with the limited OTA channel selection."
\r\n1) The apps have some significant issues. The Amazon app will work fine for a few days and then inevitably start throwing error messages when you select a show/episode to stream ("A problem was encountered..."). Rebooting the Tivo will resolve it, but this gets tiresome. The Plex app cannot playback about 20% of the videos in my local library. These videos work fine when viewed on iOS plex, windows plex, etc. When using Spotify elsewhere on your home network, the Bolt shows up within Spotify as an available "Spotify Connect" device (so you can send audio to it) but it doesn\'t actually work (no audio is actually heard on the Tivo). The Spotify app on the Tivo is missing Spotify Radio. 
"\r\n2) As of 12/18/2015, you cannot stream to a device outside your home (e.g. iphone over LTE). Tivo advertised this feature and claims it is coming.  We've been waiting 2+ months thus far."
"\r\n3) Tivo made some head-scratching decisions around commercial skipping. For example, on programs where skipping IS available, you have to click the SKIP button on EACH commercial break. Why not simply enable 'skipmode' for the length of the recording? Who would want to see some commercials but not others? Another example: Commercial skipping is apparently never available on sports - even when sports programs are among the top primetime programs (e.g. Sunday Night Football)."
"\r\n4) From the Bolt, you can only stream to ONE device (mobile phone, tablet, PC, etc.) at a time. Given the general (fast) speed of the Bolt in almost every regard, this limitation caught me by surprise. It *seems* like it would have the horsepower for at least two streams. If i could sacrifice the resources consumed by a tuner to turn this on - I gladly would. You might be able to buy one of the add-on streaming devices intended for older Tivo devices and use it with the Bolt to add a second stream (I haven't tried)."
"\r\n5) The app selection has some major holes - namely WatchESPN, HBO, MLB, and NFL Network. Even though the device is linked to the Opera TV app store, it sadly doesn't have the opera browser (or any browser) for general internet browsing."
\r\n6) The web-based viewing available at online.tivo.com has some bugs. It mostly works, but sometimes the UI becomes unresponsive (30-second skip just stops responding). Other times the progress tracker gets out of sync with real progress and clicking on the progress bar (to jump ahead/behind) takes you to an unexpected place in the recording.
"\r\n7) Offline download to a mobile device is painfully slow. Granted, the Tivo has to transcode the raw recording to something appropriate for a mobile device, but the transcoding engine runs like a dog. Downloading an hour-long HD recording to my iphone 5s over 802.11n 5ghz wifi at the 'LOW' quality level was taking almost 30 minutes, until I installed an SSD drive which cut it to 20 minutes (still too slow)."
"\r\n8) There are (relatively unobtrusive) ads buried throughout the device. When you're paying $150/year in subscription fees, you really don't expect to see ads coming from Tivo itself."
\r\n9) No picture-in-picture. I guess I just assumed this was ubiquitous by 2015, but apparently not.
\r\n10) No voice control/search (a la Roku, Apple TV, etc.). This is a big one. Tivo built bluetooth into the Bolt so this feature could presumably be added later through a new remote control.
\r\n11) Tivo has done a pretty good job of controlling "feature-creep" on their DVRs, but the remote has gotten a little crazy. When I hand it to a visitor and they need help finding the power button for the TV, you know something has gotten out of whack. You get used to it as the owner, but there is a curve.
\r\nWith the Bolt (and to some extent with the prior Roamio model), Tivo has tried to create a "unified entertainment system" which is both a DVR and streaming device in one. Presumably this means you can own one less device, you can search across recordings/guide data/streaming services, and you don\'t have to switch to a different TV input for streaming. This is a great idea that should be applauded. Unfortunately, Tivo hasn\'t nailed it (yet). The DVR side of the product is best-in-class: It\'s insanely good. However, most people will not be satisfied with the current state of the streaming apps (offering gaps, bugs). Most people will still want/need a better streamer (Roku, AppleTV, etc.). With that consideration in mind is the Bolt worth $299-$399 up front, and then $150/year (after the first year) for exceptional DVR functionality? "Yes," if you can afford the price tag.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm coming from WMC HDHR too, but I had Tivo years ago, so perhaps that's why I'm not as impressed with the overall experience.  I'm happy, but I was expecting it to be even more advanced 10 years later!"
"\nAs to the commercial skip feature, I suspect it's not automatic for the entire show to avoid the legal issues another DVR company faced.  As I understand it, they were slightly different, eliminating the commercials entirely from the recording, but I think requiring user input at each commercial break is probably safer."
"\nMaybe I missed it, but the things I appreciate the most are the ability to add/check programs from any browser and/or the mobile app.  Particularly nice not to have to try to type on a Tivo as opposed to your smartphone.  Also, from your smartphone you don't even have to interrupt watching another program.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"8) There are (relatively unobtrusive) ads buried throughout the device. When you're paying $150/year in subscription fees, you really don't expect to see ads coming from Tivo itself."
"Of course you can expect whatever you want but the issue for TiVo is the hardware can't be sold at a profit and the service fees alone just won't generate adequate profits for TiVo to stay in business, the ads bring some additional revenue.  The market for a product like TiVo is just so small which is why there are no other products like TiVo and the few companies that attempted to compete with TiVo are long gone."
\nI have got to hand it to you for being able to make Windows Media Center work for so long.  I had TiVo first and added a WMC trial and thought it was brutal to use in comparison, although probably the second best option for many years, it was a distant second to my way of thinking.
\nNice post and summary of the differences.\n\t\t\t\t\t
I have got to hand it to you for being able to make Windows Media Center work for so long.  I had TiVo first and added a WMC trial and thought it was brutal to use in comparison, although probably the second best option for many years, it was a distant second to my way of thinking.
Which version did you have?  The Windows 7 version was much better than the Vista version (and I think there was a version before that).  But when they switched guide information provider earlier this year it became unbearable. 
"\nMy main complaint with WMC is it didn't notify you of conflicts which would pop up well after adding a recording.  Tivo used to have a notification--not sure about the Bolt because I haven't had the device long enough for a new conflict to pop up."
\nI did have to resolve a conflict after adding a recording, and I thought WMC did that better.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\nI think most people agree with you that the DVR side certainly out shines the Streaming Video side of current TiVos.  The good news is that TiVo is very actively working on the streaming side so I think there is a very good chance we will see continued and significant improvement.  I am a light user of YouTube, Vudu, & Amazon and have had very few problems with those apps, also use Pandora allot and rarely have issue with that app.\n\t\t\t\t\t
"\nThe Bolt will continue to improve. Tivo's always had issues keeping up with all the streaming apps, and possibly will for the foreseeable future, but I think 2016 will be an interesting year."
\nThe latest software release enables the second transcoder for portable devices, so that should cover #4 of the Bad. Transcoding is pretty computationally intense. It\'s "slow" but I respect that it can be done in roughly 2x real-time speed. My 3.3GHz computer isn\'t much faster at it. 
"8) There are (relatively unobtrusive) ads buried throughout the device. When you're paying $150/year in subscription fees, you really don't expect to see ads coming from Tivo itself."
"One of the reasons why I don't want to give up Windows Media Center.  That and having an honest to goodness, full fledged, capable version of Plex (and/or Emby).\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"As to the commercial skip feature, I suspect it's not automatic for the entire show to avoid the legal issues another DVR company faced.  As I understand it, they were slightly different, eliminating the commercials entirely from the recording, but I think requiring user input at each commercial break is probably safer."
o the Dish network DVR has a feature called "AutoHop"
\r\n"To skip commercials during your favorite primetime shows with AutoHop, just wait to view those programs. When AutoHop is enabled, you\'ll be prompted at the first commercial break of your recorded primetime content asking if you\'d like to skip through commercials. Simply indicate "yes," and AutoHop will remember your preference and skip all commercials for the remainder of the program. Freedom from advertisements \xc2\x97 now that\'s something worth waiting for." [

Cord-cutting and DVRs might not seem like they belong in the same sentence, but the TiVo Roamio OTA combines the best of both worlds, adding DVR capabilities to broadcast TV along with streaming from most major services. Now the line is getting an upgrade, including one\xc2\xa0important addition and another important subtraction.
oday TiVo unveiled the Roamio OTA 1TB, adding 500GB storage\xc2\xa0that allows\xc2\xa0users to store up to 150 hours of HD content. The new model will cost users $400, but that mammoth price is easier to swallow thanks to the other big announcement: there is no need for an ongoing monthly subscription fee. That initial price covers both the hardware and the service.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe TiVo Roamio OTA 1TB is in a class of its own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ira Bahr, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s chief marketing and retail sales officer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt delivers the unparalleled TiVo DVR experience, as well as an intuitive integration between free over-the-air HD channels and major streaming services. No other device brings everything you watch together into one single, easy-to-use interface.\xe2\x80\x9d
imply plug in an HD antenna, and any local channels in your area are seamlessly integrated into the experience, complete with the SkipMode 30-second commercial skip that helped propel TiVo to stardom. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in a hurry to catch up with a favorite show, QuickMode \xe2\x80\x94 introduced last year \xe2\x80\x94 allows you to watch a show up to 30 percent faster, and with the audio pitch-corrected so the actors don\xe2\x80\x99t sound like chipmunks.
treaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Instant Video are built-in and with the OneSearch feature, both broadcast TV and streaming video can be browsed and searched at the same time. Built-in support for casting allows video from Netflix or YouTube to be streamed from a mobile device to the Roamio OTA 1TB without the need for a separate piece of hardware like a Chromecast.
, one of its most powerful features is the ability for the box to serve as your hub for all visual media. With four built-in tuners, the Roamio OTA 1TB can stream live, recorded, and OTT content to TiVo Mini devices throughout your home, and recorded shows can also be streamed to Amazon Fire or Apple TV devices.
Whether or not all that will be worth the $400 entrance fee for frugal cord-cutters remains to be seen.
he TiVo Roamio 1TB will be available starting May 2 and can be found at Best Buy stores and online via Best Buy, Amazon, and the

iVo introduces Bolt, a sleek DVR that skips commercials completely
2015-09-30
04:00:03
aking its own flavor of ad blocking to a new level, 
On Tuesday, the company announced a new DVR called TiVo Bolt, a 4K digital video recorder similar to the original TiVo but with extra functionality. These functions include being able to skip entire ad breaks of recorded shows so you can watch recorded shows 30% faster. 
What to stream on HBO, Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix in October
"Using the SkipMode feature on TiVo Bolt, users can press a button and jump through the commercial break, making binging more time-efficient. There's also a QuickMode that lets you move through tedious TV shows like awards program in record speed \xe2\x80\x94 without audio distortion. "
"The TiVo Bolt arrives at a time of piqued interest in both connected devices and commercial avoidance,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Rogers, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s President and CEO, said in a statement emailed to 
. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clear demand of consumers is for a TV experience that quickly delivers them exactly what they want the instant they turn on the screen. Bolt is a game-changer that will remind people of how they felt the first time they experienced digital recording."
"The original TiVo gives you universal search functionality through OnePass and this will be available on the Bolt, too. Universal search allows a viewer to search for content regardless of the source \xe2\x80\x94 bringing in shows from cable, on-demand services like Netflix and apps, if they're supported. "
"In a cool extra feature, you can click a button on the TiVo Bolt to make your lost remote control play a song. You also don't need to point the controller at the box, allowing for easier channel-switching. "
iVo Bolt will also provide more personalization features, including recommendations from friends, selections of content from critics, and video related to your interests.
"The new look TiVo is all-white, curved and smooth, which is a move away from the TiVo black boxes of yesteryear. It's also dramatically smaller in size than the previous models, which means you can hide it a little easier in your lounge room. "
iVo Bolt comes in two sizes \xe2\x80\x94 500GB and 1TB, costing US$300 and US$400 respectively, which is keeps the TiVo in quite a high price bracket. It will be available Sept. 30 online at TiVo.com, BestBuy.com and Amazon.com, and in stores from Oct. 4.

"TiVo's 4K-ready, commercial skipping Bolt hints at the future"
09.30.15\n
his new Bolt DVR may not totally remake the recording technology TiVo is famous for, but it introduces a sharp departure in design and adds features customers have asked for since it started in the late 90s. 
", the Bolt is a funky arc-shaped white box that looks different from anything else near your HDTV. Despite being smaller than TiVo's older DVRs -- or whatever cable box you probably have -- it's eye-catching enough for visitors to stop and ask what you're watching TV on. Looks aside, Bolt's main claim to fame will definitely be its ability to bypass commercials with a new SkipMode (No more hidden 30 second skip! "
"We've been asking for this since 2009"
", and while it's appreciated, where I see evidence of TiVo looking towards the future is the way it's connecting the DVR to Amazon's Fire TV. "
\n            Gallery: TiVo Bolt | 10 Photos\n          
"Let's start with the new hardware. TiVo Bolt will replace "
"That funky arc shape isn't just there to stick out visually however, as VP Jim Denney told us it also allows the smaller box to vent from the bottom. It's a rather unique design, and in our short time using it the box stayed cool and quiet. The upgraded hardware is good for more than just pixel-pushing too, with apps and menus responding faster than ever. One tweak you'd almost miss? It still has the Roamio Pro's tiny Remote Finder button on the back, perfect for times when the RF-connected control has slipped between couch cushions somewhere. In general, things are the same as they ever were, including stuff like CableCARD setups, and transferring your Series Recordings via TiVo's sometimes-frustrating website. That's definitely one aspect that could use a 2015-style makeover to resemble modernized platforms like iOS, Xbox or Spotify."
he biggest changes however, are in the software. With "SkipMode" TiVo drops in a feature featured its old competitor 
, and more recently by Dish Network\'s "
" DVRs. It works just like it sounds, when you\'re watching a recorded program, a green icon will pop up and prompt you to hit the "D" button to skip commercials. Easy, right? Right, but there are some limitations. TiVo is managing this by basically having people watch the programs on certain networks (the top 20 or so most popular, between 4PM and midnight) and mark where the actual show begins and the commercials end. Your Bolt downloads the information, and is ready for skipping at will shortly after the shows are recorded. You\'ll know which shows have commercials that can be skipped, because they\'ve got a big green skip button in the guide now. The only bad news? SkipMode is not being ported back to older DVRs, but it should work on the Mini (as long as it\'s connected to a Bolt.)
"We tried it out and everything worked without a hitch. TiVo's scheme covers the lions share of our primetime TV programming, and being able to easily skip commercials can make it easier to blow through shows quickly. In that same vein, TiVo is also adding QuickMode (unlike SkipMode, this will be available for the Roamio and Premiere), which lets viewers watch recordings sped up by 30 percent, but pitch corrects the audio so it doesn't sound any different. Many of you told us you listened to the old HD Podcast that way, and we can confirm, if you're bingeing on a series to catch up before the finale, it makes things go by faster without seriously compromising the experience."
"What we didn't get a chance to try was the Bolt's Ultra HD chops, but according to TiVo it will have two 4K-ready apps at launch: YouTube and "
. The menu has been tweaked slightly, and while that change won\'t be copied onto older hardware, Premiere and Roamio users can expect a guide update that adds more channel logos. Other software tweaks coming in a fall update will bring a personalized "What to Watch" section on iOS, better social sharing on Facebook and Twitter, and a slicker OnePass experience 
"Getting Personal \xe2\x80\x93 A Fall update will deliver new features to TiVo's iOS app that will allow you to create a personalized 'What to Watch' screen by selecting categories based on your hobbies and interests. Content matching your interests will then populate your 'My Shows' folder."
hare with Friends \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo is taking social sharing to the next level. This update will allow you to share a link to your favorite show with all your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter and more. Upon clicking on that link, TiVo will take your friends to a page on an iOS or Android device or on the Web indicating where they can watch that show.
iVo Online \xe2\x80\x93 Creating OnePass selections will be easier than ever on TiVo Online with OnePass Quick Select. Upon updating, OnePass will include default options highlighting your favorite programs with a single click.
I think the best news of today is that TiVo will finally extend itself to other connected TV boxes. 
". It's not out yet, but when it launches you should be able to watch easily recordings from anywhere else in the home. With a little hacking "
people have already been doing just that
", but official support is a move in the right direction. Making TiVo work smoothly with other devices would make the ecosystem much more valuable, and I hope it's just the start of a trend."
Bolt pre-orders start today online -- check the usual sources like Amazon (
") and Best Buy -- with shipments on October 4th, and units should reach retail shelves in the next week or so. The only difference between the two versions offered are the size of the 2.5-inch HDD inside, at 500GB ($299) or 1TB ($399), and both come with the first year of TiVo service included. Is that enough to get buyers away from cable DVRs or custom setups? By including the first year of service TiVo is taking some of the upfront pricing pressure off, which is a big reason why I haven't always recommended it right away. I'd like to see more work done on those apps for other connected devices (Roku, Xbox, PlayStation... "
"?) before making the switch full time, but if you're in the mood for an upgrade, the Bolt is a great option right out of the box."

"Purchased this TiVo OTA 1TB on 5/19/2016. This TiVo Over the Air model includes the TiVo subscription in the $399 price. The first thing you need to do when you get this unit home is register it with TiVo to activate the subscription. You can do this online or on the phone. I chose the Phone method. They were very polite and knowledgeable however I must warn you TiVo will ask you for your credit card number even though they won't charge you for the monthly subscription since it's included in the price. We will see in a month or two what happens?\r\nSet up was easy. Connect it up to your tv via HDMI, connect it to your antenna, connected to the internet via Ethernet. You can also use WiFi but who wants to go thru the hassle. Lastly connect it to power. After it powers up you answer a few questions and then you do some waiting. About 2 hours. It downloads some updates, scans your tv stations, downloads the guide, downloads more updates. It boots up at least 2 times. One thing you need to know. It has no on/off switch or button. TiVo always runs. I even called up Tech Support to confirm this and they were very friendly, polite and knowledgeable. My final test was for me to use the program guide to select 4 tv shows on different channels all starting at the same time. End result, all 4 tv shows recorded and they were beautiful. Only time will tell what issues and questions will occur."

"I'm in the process of cutting the cord and one thing I couldn't see doing without is the DVR, so I decided to give the TiVo Roamio OTA a whirl. Fortunately, it does the job and does it well. It's a bit of an up-front financial investment, but with the money you'll save every month on cable/satellite fees and the fact that TiVo no longer charges for the monthly guide service, it'll pay for itself in no time. The installation and setup was pretty straightforward and they give you a clear step by step guide to follow. After it's all hooked up, you turn everything on, follow the on-screen prompts, and register your account online. Once everything is activated, you're good to go. If you're coming from a different DVR service, the menus and features will take a little getting used to, but overall it's very well done. Having 4 tuners and all the major streaming media services (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Huiu, etc.) built in is a major plus. All that being said, your experience will completely depend on getting a good Over The Air HD antenna that works best for your location. I would suggest experimenting with different antennas FIRST with just your TV, finding the one that works best for you, THEN buy the TiVo once you know you can get the channels you want. If you're not able to receive the station broadcasts you like to watch, the whole thing is pretty much pointless."

Good equipment but poor service for program quide
Have been a longtime Tivo customer so this is why I hate to write this review but people need to know what has happened to Tivo service. Since the Tivo merger with Rovi customer service has gone out the window. The program service was changed and now it is almost impossible to get a correct lineup for your machine and they appear uninterested in complaints. Even the tech people that answer the phone sound frustrated and defensive. Both my machines have served me well over the years but now a large part of my shows have to be manually set up. Consider this before before getting stuck with a Tivo machine.

"Although I did not buy my Tivo Roamio OTA from Best Buy, but I do on most electronics I buy, buyers should be forewarned that TIVO has real issues with programming since the company was purchased by ROVI, the programming guide corporation. A recent software update to Tivo programming has created issues with not accepting all channels or networks. Tivo's service to resolve this issue is non-existant. Consumers should shop for other alternative products. IF YOU DO PURCHASE a Tivo, do not pay for a lifetime programming subscription as it is a waste of money. But then, if you don't, you are playing right into Rovi/Tivo's hand since monthly subscriptions are more profitable to the company. Regardless of which way you go, YOU LOSE! I love Best Buy. It would be nice if their company would also put pressure on Rovi/Tivo to resolve this issue."

"The TiVo Roamio OTA DVR is a great way to get the functionality of a satellite/cable DVR without the cost or subscription commitment. An upfront purchase gives you access to your local TV schedules, with the ability to record, pause, rewind and fast forward through programming\xe2\x80\x94features that we really missed when we cancelled our satellite service. Also the remote control is very ergonomic and comfortable to use, so much better than the one that came with our TV. It's nice that the Roamio gives you integrated access to Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, etc., but unfortunately CBS All Access is not yet integrated into this system (maybe soon?) One annoying thing is that the unit will sometimes be in recording mode, spontaneously recording a suggested programming choice based on your past viewing/recording habits; fortunately there's a way to disable this. Customer support is very accessible and helpful in this regard."

"I've missed having the convenience of a DVR since cutting the cord a couple years ago, but the Tivo Roamio OTA finally provided a solution I was comfortable with trying. My biggest considerations prior to purchasing an OTA DVR were the quality of the tuners and the long-term viability of the unit. With the Tivo name, I was not worried about viability as compared with some of the other options. After purchasing the unit and using it for around 6 weeks, I can confidently say that the tuners in the unit are as good as if not slightly better than the tuner on my Samsung TV. The included RF remote is quick and responsive, but programing my Harmony remote has shown a little bit of lag with it's use. The included apps (Hulu, Amazon, etc) are slow to load and buffer as compared to my Roku units, but there is a convenience factor with Tivo One Pass which will keep track of shows that i am not able to get OTA as they are being added to one of my subscription services. Overall, the Roamio OTA is a competent option for those of us who don't want to spend a fortune on cable/satellite but still want the flexibility provided by a DVR."

I finally cut the cord in July. Saving over $100 a month now just for TV service from U-verse. Buying the TiVo Roamio OTA was a no brainer for me since I still wanted to recorded live TV over an antenna. I also tried the Tablo TV. While I liked the concept, the picture quality is not as good as TiVo (or live TV) and waiting for live TV or recorded shows to play was frustrating. You get none of that with the TiVo. Everything works quickly, and the picture quality is really good.

o far so good, but but fan whirrs extremely loud
"Purchased this at Best Buy about 45 days ago and in last week after I passed the 30 day in store assistance, about 4am each day (evidently to wake me up in the middle of the night), the fan starts whirring very loudly every night. The first time it happened, I was able to lightly tap the top left and it got quiet, but that hasn't worked since. I use this in my bedroom so there is no escaping this loud noise it makes for it to be so brand new. Very disappointing, but I still like Tivo overall."

Bought new on 7-2-16. It broke down 3 months later. Tivo sent a replacement that was rebuilt not new. It broke down within 4 days. They will not replace my new unit with a new unit instead sending another rebuilt unit. I paid for a new unit not a rebuilt one. Tivo - Poor Poor Poor

"Bought this from BB 99 days ago. And suddenly the fan started making a loud buzzing noise.. Sounds like a bearing.. So called support, and they informed me that my Warranty was expired (by 9days), and it would be $149.00 to repair. Apparently the 1 year parts coverage doesn't mean anything. He said even if it was covered under warranty it would still be a $49.00 shipping cost. That is outrageous so just beware if you have a issue, most likely the cheap fan, it will cost you. Going to see if I can find a fan on the web somewhere.. How disappointed in TIVO. GREAT product till it breaks."

"I have had my Tivo for about 2 months now and I am mostly happy with the tivo. I have two complaints that are keeping me from giving it 5 stars. The first complaint is that the wireless tuner that is in the tivo is not that good. I only get 55 to 60% signal strength on it. So sometimes when I am streaming it will lag and freeze. If it is lagging and freezing enough I will have to switch over to my PS3 to finish watching my show. All of my other wireless devices get around 80% - 90% strength and work fine. My router is only 15 feet away from the tivo box. My 2nd complainant is that about a month after I got my tivo they made some changes to the guide service and I didn't have a guide and could not DVR anything for about 2 weeks."

he TiVo Roamio is a great device. I recently " cut the cord" but wanted to be able to have a tv guide and recorder. The Roamio provides exactly what I wanted with no monthly fees. The commercial skip button is the BOMB!! Love it!! Netflix and Amazon seem to load in half the time that it took my Smart TV to load them. The picture and sound quality is outstanding. I am extremely happy with the Roamio - kudos to TiVo.

"I finally found the one OTA unit that can replace Windows Media Center - Tivo's Roamio OTA. I am absolutely thrilled! I still have four tuners, lifetime guide, web access, wow! I was worried that I would not be able to find a suitable replacement for Media Center but the Roamio is way more reliable than using a pc. It truly is a TV appliance. In the settings you can enable sleep mode - and it works. The remote can control my other equipment - nice. The only difficulty was adjusting to terminology like Season Pass. And it would be nice if there was a stop button for recordings. Otherwise I'm lovin it."

When I finally cut uverse and cable out of my life, I was happy with the tv programs, but I missed having the ability to back up the program, pause a program, or record. The DVR I missed more than the cable programming. So when I decided to try the tivo, I was so pleased to find out it did all of those things and more. I could stream amazon prime with it, it showed me the tv listings and upcoming shows and gave tv info. I am sure there is even more it can do, I just have been too content to look for more.

"I love my new TiVo. Commercial skip is great. No future dvr fees is also awesome. However, to have multi room viewing, multiple TiVo minis or a TiVo stream is required at $150 a pop. So it's awesome but too expensive for multiple screens"

Weak tuner, and does not record reliably
he main reason I got this was to record OTA shows. First problem is that the on-board tuner on this unit is garbage and does not pick up as many channels as the tuner in my Sony TV on the exact same Mohu Leaf antenna. So, I get fewer channels that actually show a decent picture. The program guide just shows all available channels for my zip code, not the channels that have actually been picked up by the weak onboard tuner. So unless I tune to a particular channel I never know if it works. Second main problem is that on most local channels, the Season pass recording does not work at all, even if I delete and reset everything multiple times as directed on the Tivo support forums. It cannot even record Jeopardy daily on ABC, even though the signal is strong and clear. I have to manually set individual shows to record that works fine. \r\n\r\nI am returning this unit for a refund now.

"I'd been using an Xbox One with Hauppauge tuner for the past year, and it was working fine. I decided to step up to the Tivo Roamio for DVR functionality, but the reception on this device is horrible. Using the same same Clearstream 2v positioned at the same location, reception on the Roamio is gets interrupted with blocky squares and broken audio. To test, for a given station I would try on the Roamio until problems arose (this happened quickly), then remove the RG6 and plug it into Xbox (problems would disappear and not return). I tried adding an attenuator to my setup, but no difference."

I bought this so I could record programs off the air from my local stations. After reading the reviews, I ordered this and received it from Best Buy within a few days. Contrary to some of the reviews, the online registration process was quick, as was the setup of the TiVo. Including upgrading of the software, the unit was up and running in about two hours with no problems. It took a few days to get accustomed to the menus, and setting up the One Pass, not much different than when I switched satellite TV providers last year. This product is really great.

his is my second purchase, I bought my first one about a year ago this one is for my son. When I bought my first one I wanted to get rid of cable/satellite. I had DirecTV which I loved but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love the price so I wanted to cut the cord but I rely heavily on recording my shows. The Best Buy member recommended this item. He said I could use it on antenna and record my shows. What he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention was that I can add my passwords to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon prime. When I add shows to a one pass list to record it will also tell me if that show is available in and in which app and how much it is to either rent or buy in every app Whether or not It is on an antenna TV channel and I can still stream it. I have now use that search or one pass to check and see if movies or shows are available on the specific app instead of checking all of the apps to see if it\xe2\x80\x99s there or to find out which way is the cheapest to rent or buy the show. This particular model cost 150 a one time annual charge to use the specific models features. But, when you figure 150 year versus 142\xc3\x9712 year I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved a lot. I stopped to pay for Hulu prime and I stopped to pay for Hulu prime and Netflix, But, I was doing that anyway and I was only watching one or two shows that I could not get on antenna and I have always seem to find a way to stream it. The only thing this box does not do is let me have, or add my passwords for other streaming things like the network apps or Crunchyroll ( my sons) Or my biggie Apple TV so that I could find any movie or compare any movie or show across all devices to search for a movie or its price\r\n Or my biggie Apple TV so that I could find any movie or compare any movie or show across all devices to search for movie And or Compare their price.

I am not absolutely crazy about the shape... It does what it is supposed to do. The only reservations I have are about the synching of the remote with my A/V receiver and the fact that not all the shows that you recorded on the old TIVO can be transferred to the new one. Some of them cannot be due to licencing limitations...

"I must say I'm not overly excited with the TiVo box. Menu system is over the top complex. It keeps recording certain shows that I never asked it to record. Easy to delete, but why??!! Sometimes recording quality of shows that I did want to record are not very good! Recording quality of my DVR from the cable company were considerably better! I saved a bit of money versus DVR from cable company but not sure it's worth it. I would not buy this again."

he Tivo bolt definitely is a better alternative to most dvrs provided by the cable company. 4 tuners, lots of storage, and one button commercial skipping are huge positives. It\xe2\x80\x99s also incredibly small! However, the UI is lacking some of the polish and consistency I would expect. These are things that can improve over time.

his was very easy to set up, Follow the instructions for the connections, turn it on and let it find your channel guide and online apps. The recorder is much easier than the Direct TV, and the commercial skip is fantastic. Record 4 programs at the same time, so never miss your favorite shows.

"Was a TiVo customer for 10 years and gave up on their slow hardware and dying technology. Due to a recent move decided to give them a shot and take a look at the new hardware. Gotta say they've once again hit it out of the park."
eviewer Rating 5 out of 5 stars 
My cable provider uses extremely outdated equipment with poor performance and no modern convenience features. I have limited options for providers in my area so decided to do the Tivo. I now have features that compete with the big name brand providers (at significantly cheaper prices!) and overall much better experience. Only cons were not clear enough indications that a subscription to Tivo service (separate from your tv provider) is required. It is fairly inexpensive and worth it but still was kind of annoyed to discover after I had already purchased the item. Also the set up was extremely difficult though more likely due to my service provider than Tivo. It would have helped if Tivo gave a better indication of what was wrong however.

"This TiVo box did not meet our expectations mainly because the quality of the taped shows, several stops and skips on various shows, and the box itself doesn't respond to the remote very well. It takes several clicks before it responds. We changed the batteries and it made no difference. We will be returning this box."

Whit the unit works well, I wanted one that work with an Over The Air antenna. This was the largest capacity one that would work with OTA antenna. I saw that it had a connection that would allow for an external eSATA drive. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I bought the unit and saw that the list of compatible eSATA drives are all discontinued. You CAN buy them for 2-3 times (or more) what you can get a new one for. But why would you buy a discontinued 5 year old drive? Very disappointed in the capacity options for this.

Very pleased now that I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it.
Had the following set-up: basic cable, antenna-DVR, Roku with Amazon Prime, Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu with Showtime, & DVD player. My wife was extremely irate about so many remote controls (had another one just for the TV), so I bought a TiVO Bolt. There were some beginning problems - it takes about 30 minutes on the phone with your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s tech dept., after you trade in your cable box for a different one. The TiVO remote was malfunctioning, BestBuy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t replace the remote only, so I had to call TiVO before I disconnected the whole set-up to return it. TiVO mailed me a new remote. While I was waiting for it to arrive, the Bolt came disconnected from its power source during the cable box switch. Reconnected it & the remote worked fine. Had to d/c the HBO Now service & get it thru Amazon Prime. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had the Bolt connected for over a month now & we both love it. The remote for the Bolt controls everything but the DVD player, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched a DVD in months, so that\xe2\x80\x99s ok. Our previous DVR would only worked with the antenna, and reception was spotty and channels limited. Now we can record any channel we get on cable, without a monthly DVR payment to the cable company. The Roku had a lot more apps/channels than the Bolt does, but most of the missing ones we never watched anyway. The Bolt remote controls the everyday functions of the TV (channels, volume, power) so that remote is in a drawer. I am SO glad we made this change & got the Bolt. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than what we were using.

Love watching TV shows without commercials? Then you might be interested in the new TiVo Bolt, an all-in-one DVR with a mode that lets you 
In fact, the new player seems to be all about speed. Not only does it rocket you through commercials\xe2\x80\x94one at a time or an entire block\xe2\x80\x94using SkipMode, it also has an innovative QuickMode, which the company claims wisks you through recorded shows up to 30 percent faster without causing any audio sync issues. Imagine watching a replay of the Academy Awards, for example, in less than three hours\xe2\x80\x94all without missing a word.
"SkipMode doesn't work with sports\xe2\x80\x94so you'll have to live with beer ads\xe2\x80\x94but QuickMode can speed up the action during play lags."
Like other TiVo models, the distinctively angled Bolt box offers multiple sources of content\xe2\x80\x94cable, video on demand, over-the air (via an antenna) broadcasts, and streaming\xe2\x80\x94with universal search capability. It can also record up to four shows at once. And its HDMI 2.0 output makes this the first TiVo to support 4K video content.
"The SkipMode ad feature frees you from repeatedly hitting a 30-second skip button or futilely trying to pull your finger off the fast-forward button precisely at commercial's end. For now, though, it's somewhat limited. It only works with recorded programs from specific providers\xe2\x80\x94TiVo says that includes the top 20 most-watched networks\xe2\x80\x94and (unlike QuickMode) it's not offered at all on sports programs. To see if a show is skip-enabled, look in your My Shows folder, where titles will be listed with skip icons beside them."
Let us know what you think of the new TiVo Bolt in the comments section below
"The TiVo Bolt will start appearing in stores October 4th. It's already available online at TiVo, Amazon, and Best Buy. It comes in two flavors: The 500GB hard drive model costs $300 and the 1TB version is priced at $400. Both include one year of TiVo service, which currently costs $150."
iVo says it will offer a few updates this fall, including the ability to create a personalized "what to watch" screen based on your hobbies and interests, and a social sharing feature that provides links so your friends can watch the same show as you.
"The TiVo Bolt replaces the basic TiVo Roamio model in the company's lineup, but the other "

In comparison to the Roamio DVRs, however, the Bolt has a faster processor, improved Wi-Fi (it supports 802.11AC), and more memory, so we imagine it will operate more quickly. If you decide to get a TiVo Bolt, let us know what you think of it, and how well the commercial skip feature works.
