iVo Hydra/Gen4 User Interface reviews and comments thread\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
"\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn this the eve of the TiVo Hydra/Gen4 User Interface, I thought that it might make sense to establish a separate thread where users' reviews and comments on the new UI could be consolidated.  Feel free to use this thread for that purpose.  "
\nGiven the breath of the topic, I separately have put up a TiVo VOX/voice remote control reviews and comments thread (under the TiVo Coffeehouse - TiVo Discussion sub-forum) and a TiVo Mini VOX/4K reviews and comments thread (under the TiVo Mini sub-forum), to try to make it easier for people to find what they might be looking for.  Feel free to use those threads as well. 
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAt midnight tonight are we gonna be able to go Hydra?? After all the talk it seems crazy we are on the brink of the last? TiVo UI.\n\t\t\t\t\t
t midnight tonight are we gonna be able to go Hydra?? After all the talk it seems crazy we are on the brink of the last? TiVo UI.
ccording to TiVo_Ted they will start migrating the servers at midnight PDT but it might be a couple hours before the link is available\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTick Tock The clock is fast approaching. Is the launch of Hydra starting at Midnight Eastern Standard Time or Will it be Pacific time..... Tick Tock......\n\t\t\t\t\t
We start migrating the website at midnight PDT. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to post the link yet, because I think there will be a short period where it\xe2\x80\x99s live, but not fully working. I would guess it will be ready by 3am Pacific.
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s see some screen shots of how things look on Hydra! Very curious to see how Hydra is different from Gen3...
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tActually Merg Has the right idea. Cant wait to see what happens as in a positive way that is...Not expecting any night terrors from the Update/Upgrade...
\nfingers crossed in anticipation.. Oh its 12:06am here now... no change..\n\t\t\t\t\t
ctually Merg Has the right idea. Cant wait to see what happens as in a positive way that is...Not expecting any night terrors from the Update/Upgrade...

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJust did a forced call at 3:34 AM and so far no prompt to upgrade to Hydra.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tInstalling something right now... not sure what the update is but I am assuming its Hydra.... will let you know.
\n1st couple minutes it looks like a soso-cableCo STB system upgrade 
\nafter a few minutes and bouncing through menus -- I must say its sharp clean and very modern!  I like it.     Lets see how it goes over the next few days!\n\t\t\t\t\t

"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tok upgraded to hydra... don't see the downgrade app very annoyed at that.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyone with a mini get updated? Mine is endlessly trying to connect to tivo central then goes black. No prompt to upgrade.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOk here is the skinny only have the bolt updated.
Cannot see any other TiVo devices on my network
. can now see the other Tivos Can stream to Bolt.
"\nand not able to Transfer videos. that's a problem."
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMy Bolt, which is running Hydra, can see my Roamio Basic which is not running Hydra. Using Ethernet.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWell I can see my Other Tivos... would like to transfer shows as its way easier to watch that way...But at the end of the day I can still stream it so its not all that bad... 
\nOver all my first impressions are very favourable. Like the zippiness of the update. but where is the downgrade app that was supposed to be there.\n\t\t\t\t\t

he switch has been flipped and Hydra is now available to TiVo Bolt, Roamio, and Mini owners who want it. However, you probably want to 
\xc2\xa0before proceeding. Further, the downgrade app, should you later choose to throw in the towel, does not yet appear to be available and TiVo Minis\xc2\xa0
hould that not be enough to dissuade, here\xe2\x80\x99s how to get in early on the optional upgrade:\xc2\xa0
, log into TiVo.com, and select the boxes you\xe2\x80\x99d like to update. The TiVo Service Numbers are being swept in every two hours so, should the 24-48 hour wait be too long, you\xe2\x80\x99d go into your network settings to force a connection to receive the update and then reboot to apply it.
Keep in mind any Minis you have will ultimately need to match the host DVR interface. So excluding them or trying to prioritize them within the request form won\xe2\x80\x99t ultimately mean anything. With that in mind, I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest updating everything or nothing.
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough time with Hydra to pass judgement, other than to say I appreciate 
\xc2\xa0and find the animations, transitions, etc very smooth \xe2\x80\xa6 although there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be significant retraining in regards to deprecation of the left directional button and rethinking of the now playing show info banner, plus who knows what else. Also, at a meta analytical level, the new interface has me wondering what makes TiVo a TiVo. Hm.

ope, not gonna be a beta tester for this one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let others work the bugs out.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve always appreciated your highly precise technical explanations. 
Currently doing the wait a while phase on my one Mini. I actually really like Hydra so far.
My bolt and Mini are updated now as well.  If you have a Bolt, the upgrade to the new UI i surprisingly fast. I am use to update taking forever with Tivos, but it was done in no time. Did not take too much more longer for the mini either. 
Here are my findings at first glance.. 
For people who like the play all in folder feature you will be sorely disappointed. That feature is missing.
lso if you want to sort your shows by date. Viewing by All Recordings defaults to seasons and when you sort by date, it still sorts by season first and throws other episodes in an \xe2\x80\x9cExtra\xe2\x80\x9d heading.  A workaround until they fix this is use All Shows for the listing.  There, you can sort by date and it does this. 
lso in the All Recordings view, if you change to sort by date, exit out and go back it reverts back to seasons. 
ll shows, if you want to make date as default, one your change it for a show, and go back it will remember your last sort option. 
he new UI is a shock if your use to the old UI. But being a TiVo customer for over 15 years, with the little I have played with it. I like it, and think it will only get better as TiVo does more updates to it. 
I say before you think you hate it, from initial view, give it some time. I was not thrilled with some things but the more I play with it, I can see why Tivo did what they did..
s for the left selector, I can see why they did this. Right is tuners, up I believe is Predictions strip and down is whats currently on channel and coming up, and pressing channel up and down you can scroll whats on other channels and left is channel favorites you select. 
But not everyone will be interested in favorites and I hope that Tivo will give you the option not have left selector as favorites or back to appease people. 
My big problem with the back button to use now, its too close to the input button and when I try to go back I am finding myself changing the input on my TV :-) 
the HD UI was a pretty big update but not too huge of a change from the SD to me. It was still basically a TiVo UI.. This UI is not your parents Buick\xe2\x80\xa6 Its totally new and think its time TiVo made a big change like this.
I like the colors of the UI, it allows the content to shine and stand out. 
o hats off to TiVo for a great job,  I am finding a few little quirks that I think TiVo will hopefully fix soon but if you love change, go for it, If change scares you. Go to a Best Buy or some store that hopefully has it on display to play with to see what you think.
I always upgrade to the new OS ASAP, but if I can\xe2\x80\x99t transfer my programs from the tivo, I\xe2\x80\x99m holding off as long as possible.
You can download recordings off the TiVo. What you can\xe2\x80\x99t do is upload from computer-
-TiVo. You can also transfer recordings between TiVos, but requires TiVo.com vs initiating on box.
o far so good, just finished updating TiVo Roamio Plus (took less than 5 min, but generic message stated it could take 1 hour, NICE I like 5 min better). Just spent 10 min with Hydra and so far I like it.  Need to check my 1st gen and 2nd gen TiVo Mini Units to see how those units handled the upgrade.  One thing that may be a concern is NO BACK button it 1st gen TiVo Mini, I may have to use TiVo button a lot on that remote, heck I know I will.
You can still transfer your recordings from the TiVo. As long as it\xe2\x80\x99s not restricted by your cable provider. I just transferred a couple of shows to my PC. One with KMTTG and one with pyTiVo Desktop.
he problem is you can\xe2\x80\x99t transfer from a PC back to the TiVo.
Ok so GREAT news for TiVo Mini 1st gen,  while remote does not have BACK button it does have Zoom button in the same location and it does work as \xe2\x80\x98Back\xe2\x80\x99 function, \xe2\x80\x98Zoom\xe2\x80\x99 feature has been replaced by \xe2\x80\x98Back\xe2\x80\x99.  Few bugs on Mini so far 1st channel you select when going from 1st or 2nd gen is choppy as if picture jumps every 3-4s gram by frame something wrong, but second channel you select works fine, so need a fix for that TiVo.  Also Live Tv button gives error that connection needs refresh/fix which is another bug since I can connect as mentione in previous comment.
Luckily my Gen 1 Mini upgraded without any issues.
My 4TB Bolt also just finished upgrading to Hydra. So far it seems fine.
Jakub Kudlacz: Are you sure that the Zoom buttons acts like Back?  On my Bolt, using the Zoom button (on an older remote) acts as the new Exit button.
egarding the current inability to upload shows from PC to TiVo, I think they\xe2\x80\x99d be better off removing that functionality and replacing it with the ability to use a PC as a streaming host.
James: Yes just tested again and going to My Shows then hitting Zoom button takes me back to Home, same for Apps, What To Watch, Menu.
When using Netflix, Amazon or Hulu Zoom acts like Exit. So apps behavior is different, there you have to use the Back Arrow, so not that bad because on my Newer Remote with RF Back button and Back arrow act as same button action during navigation of Movie/Show.
Jakub Kudlacz: Huh, weird.  I wonder if TiVo made the Hydra UI interpret the Zoom button differently on the Bolt than on the Mini?
hanks for the Zoom button feedback. Will need to update yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98heads up\xe2\x80\x99 post when we know more. Although I was just cleaning up vomit and bathing the responsible toddler. Not sure how much energy I have left for perusing the forums tonight. 
FYI TiVo tells me they believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve identified and resolved the two Mini problems I (and others) had previously experienced \xe2\x80\x94 cycles between home and a black window without updating and without being able to do much of anything and that crazy Opera URL error. 
my family room Mini stopped pulling live TV
Bought myself a TiVo Vox Mini today, and tried paring it to my BOLT+ Gen3 UI.  It updated software twice, and now it boots into Hydra for about 5 seconds (I can browse and all), then, a black screen with a giant gray arrow to the right appears, it stays on the screen for about a second, and then the screen goes black.  The LED flashes when I hit the directional pad, but the screen stays black.  Hitting the TiVo button causes a bong sound, but nothing happens, it just stays on a black screen. Called TiVo support and opened a ticket, they said to just let it rest and see what it does (it\xe2\x80\x99s been two hours, it\xe2\x80\x99s still on a black screen, and they\xe2\x80\x99re closed).  I imagine the giant gray arrow is the background for the \xe2\x80\x9cgo back to Gen3 or upgrade to Hydra on the BOLT+), and that I\xe2\x80\x99m hitting a bug on that screen.  It seems like the general consensus is to just lay low on Gen3 for a bit (if you\xe2\x80\x99re happy with it), so that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d *like* to do (I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Hydra will fix this Mini, and break my RF Mini).  I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a choice.  After all, how do you update software on a TiVo that sits on a black screen?  Someone on TiVoCommunity had the same issue, so they just caved and upgraded the BOLT to Hydra and that fixed it.
Justin, the arrow is part of the UI and I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing it replaces the spinner. Mini must match host DVR and the new hardware wants to use Hydra meaning you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to have to upgrade your Bolt. Not sure if the downgrade app is even available yet. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t earlier. 
Ugh!  Ted said on the forum it\xe2\x80\x99d work! 
upport thought it would downgrade, but the arrow and subsequent black screen threw them for a loop.  I trust your judgement on this one if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to let go of Gen3, haha.
 good deal of my intel has come from Ted, so I mostly defer to him. Although I prodded him on my Mini supposed CableCARD issue and the Opera link seemed to surprise. How many other v1/v2 Minis do you have and are they in critical viewing locations. You might just turn off the Vox for a week or so and then upgrade everything\xe2\x80\xa6?
his Mini was to dump a 2 Tuner Premiere I have, so I can drop the $8.50 monthly Comcast CableCARD fee on it.  So, I can sit on it. My main thought to upgrading is that if the thing kicks to a black screen after 6 seconds (my 5 seconds in Hydra, and the one second giant gray arrow), how am I going to push the update to it that fixes the downgrade even if they do fix it?
o yeah, I think you may be right. Mothball the Vox Mini until hopefully TiVo pushes an update this week for the Mini\xe2\x80\x99s, and then upgrade everything once the Mini\xe2\x80\x99s stabilize a bit.  I just know TiVo is normally painfully slow to issue OS updates (heck, it took 14 days to update our guide data when Comcast did a total lineup change, making the TiVos literally worthless for two weeks), so I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid this is on a months-long timeline, rather than a bi-weekly release schedule.  For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I believe someone hit the same CableCARD error you saw on the mini as well, but from the way they talked about it in the thread, I thought they had a Vox Mini. 
I used my Gen 1 Mini for around an hour today with Hydra. Using a Bolt as host DVR with hydra. It worked great the entire time I used it.
Overall I am really enjoying Hydra. And am glad I upgraded all my TiVos to it today.
ame here Roamio Plus, 1st gen Mini and 2nd gen Mini running great on Hydra, very happy.
My Minis still had live TV today, which is something! Muscle memory is going to be the biggest challenge for me \xe2\x80\x93 specifically the remapped directional buttons. Will percolate a few days or more and then hopefully post the Hydra Hits & Misses. Also still contemplating what makes TiVo a TiVo. With a whole new interface and inferior Rovi guide data, I wonder.
I upgraded my Roamio OTA and two Gen1 Minis last night.  The Roamio and one Gen1 went as expected.  The second Mini gave an error stating that the upgrade failed and to try again.  It also said to check my internet connection.  The internet connection was fine, so I tried again and it again failed.  So, I pulled the plug, rebooted it and it immediately went into installing the update.  Once completed, it booted up and worked as expected.
I use Harmony remotes, so I had to map a button for the \xe2\x80\x98Back\xe2\x80\x99 button.  However, the Harmony database didn\xe2\x80\x99t list a \xe2\x80\x98Back\xe2\x80\x99 button but I found it is called \xe2\x80\x98Return\xe2\x80\x99 on their list.  I mapped it to the \xe2\x80\x98Previous\xe2\x80\x99 button and will have to train my fingers to use that instead of the \xe2\x80\x98Left\xe2\x80\x99 button to return to the previous screen.
ave, thanks for the Hydra coverage and real world experience.
Okay, so one day later, with the Mini Vox sitting on the black screen the whole time, I got the downgrade prompt. I did the downgrade, and all appears to be well.
I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s visually superior \xe2\x80\x94 it looks very polished and far more \xe2\x80\x98classy.\xe2\x80\x99
I was hoping that the update would fix the Dolby dropout issue\xe2\x80\xa6 but no such luck.
ave, with the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat makes TiVo a TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d comment, does the new interface feel more generic, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly making better use of the screen real estate?  Did they lose the TiVo sounds or other things that are key TiVo?  My concern with Hydra, beyond the big, ugly bar of programming icons (which I read can be disabled) is the possibility that it no longer feels like a TiVo.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way with the Premiere when I got that with the updated interface (even though it was slooooow), but the look of Hydra has me both intrigued and frightened for not only the future of the software that I use, but the future of TiVo.   I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will tweak it to improve, but it comes back to what makes it a TiVo?  As long as we have our One Pass, My Shows list with everything we are used to, and the Live Guide (oops, minus one), I will be better equipped to \xe2\x80\x9csurvive\xe2\x80\x9d such a change,
I am not sure why everyone is freaking out about Hydra.  Yes there are changes but this should be expected of new software.  I know that in the past TiVo would mostly innovate on features not UI, maybe that is why so many people are worried Hydra won\xe2\x80\x99t work for them.  I think Hydra is a big step forward, all the menus are in HD, there is a great use of realestate new icons are easy to read and make guide actually better if you ask me I am 100% happy with it and looking forward to new features.
I though what makes TiVo is OnePass, 8s rewind, 30s fast forward, commercial skip, etc. and all that is there in much nicer packaging suitable for 21st century not 1990\xe2\x80\x99s.
\xe2\x80\x9cDave, with the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat makes TiVo a TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d comment\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
I initially puzzled over that formulation too.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s an exceedingly polite way of saying the TiVo mascot has suddenly become a character in the film 
FYI If you have Minis in the mix, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t upgrade to Hydra at this point. Many of us are still losing connectivity throughout the day to host DVR with V66 error. Requires Mini reboot. My wife is not happy. Also couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to get to her recordings this AM and called me at work, but that will come with time.
I got my 4K Mini Vox hooked up
, but haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried voice yet. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to risk waking my sick daughter last night. Several apps are missing at this point, including Amazon. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s going through the certification process with them, but keeps updating the software build which kinda resets thing. Hopefully they get that sorted in the next few weeks.
Jakub, certainly all of those features are key to making TiVo what it is, but I have all of those things in an HD interface that is easy to navigate, and fully functional.  All menus on the gen3 UI are updated now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to hear it referred to as \xe2\x80\x9c1990s\xe2\x80\x9d-esque.
I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see something that would make me want to move to Hydra beyond just a mixed-review (so far) UI change that loses the Live Guide (which I use a lot).  I know TiVo wants search to be the primary way you find programming, and I use that frequently, too, but sometimes I just scroll through the Live Guide and its hit-and-miss data to see what is out there, and cross my fingers that it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate.   
hat said, to each his/her own, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge TiVo for making this change, since the made it optional.   I will likely update at some point in the future when the issues are worked out, but hoping they bring back Live Guide before I do.  If so, I can get used to an inteface change, and may even grow to like it.
Just for reference if you upgrade now and decide you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, there is currently no rollback method released publicly. It\xe2\x80\x99s coming but no idea when.
I find Hydra to be a far more streamlined and user-friendly interface. It\xe2\x80\x99s also, IMO, far prettier.
What makes a Tivo a Tivo ? A DVR that does OTA and Cable you can own, that can be easily be hooked directly to a TV, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t force you into streaming devices to view recordings.
\n   When the smoke clears most of Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s OTA only competition won\xe2\x80\x99t be around. I actually use OTA but acknowledge cable isn\xe2\x80\x99t going away. Rovi knows this too.

Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a TiVo devotee for about a decade, and that\xe2\x80\x99s never how I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes a TiVo a TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d question.
For one, I got into TiVo before streaming was a thing. I love OnePass, but I\xe2\x80\x99d still be a TiVo user if it had never come about.
For two, while I appreciate the \xe2\x80\x9cI own it\xe2\x80\x9d part, that\xe2\x80\x99s only because I live in a metro area with 3 competing MSO\xe2\x80\x99s, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to easily bargain them down in price using my TiVo as leverage. (And that\xe2\x80\x99s partially because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been genuinely 
But really, for me at least, what \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes a TiVo a TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d is 
I came late to the party. For years, I had a wonderful CableCo Scientific Atlanta DVR that I loved. It had a UX that was quite similar to the pre-Encore TiVo, minus the superior remote. I read about TiVo, and while it seemed like it had a slightly better UX than the SA box, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem significant to me.
hen my CableCo contacted me and told me they were going to force us to switch out the Scientific Atlanta box for one from a different manufacturer. I got the model number, did a day of internet research on this box\xe2\x80\x99s UX, and I was 
. Within a few days, I had done enough research to greenlight a TiVo, and that was that.
(As it turned out, the TiVo UX was significantly better than the Scientific Atlanta UX in many subtle ways that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of.)
But for a decade, that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwhat makes a TiVo a TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d has meant to me simply: 
Windows wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a TiVo. Dunno about Moxi, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got doubts.
nd frankly, pretty much 90% of what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing about Hydra is telling me it may well not be \xe2\x80\x9ca TiVo\xe2\x80\x9d. I suspect I\xe2\x80\x99ll try Hydra out at some point, but even little stuff like making Peanut use less mental-friction-free is what gives me Halloween frights.
nd if Hydra is as screwed up for non-voice usage as I\xe2\x80\x99m currently perceiving, then MJR\xe2\x80\x99s note about integrated streaming will 
When your cable company still supplies a guide still looks like the mess found at 
But what if Comcast is your cableco and they give you X1 or DISH with Hopper? That\xe2\x80\x99s the other end of the spectrum and real nice solutions for many. But, yes, I agree that SARA is awful: 
\xe2\x80\x9cBut, yes, I agree that SARA is awful:\xe2\x80\x9d
ee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with the current SARA screenshot that Daniel H. posted. Ugly? Yup. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a good goddamn about font choices and retro graphics. I\xe2\x80\x99m a 
Back in the mid-late-\xe2\x80\x9990\xe2\x80\x99s when no one was writing software for the Mac, I stuck with it over Windows not because it was prettier, (though it was), but because it was significantly easier to use and accomplish both simple and complex tasks. A tool that creates less mental-friction in usage is what matters to me.
nd as to what Dave wrote about SARA in that linked post, after (validly) complaining about the visual clunkiness of the design choices, he then gets to the part that is important to me
\xe2\x80\x9cHaving said that, the 8300HD (actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s an 82*0) does what it should. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as polished as most other DVR experiences, but the retro visuals belie some fairly sophisticated recording options.\xe2\x80\x9d
nd that spirit tracks with my experience with SARA boxes in the 2007 and earlier era. The damn things worked intuitively, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get in my way very often. In other words, good UX. Who cares about eye candy? When I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the SARA box, was offered something worse, and thus forced towards TiVo, I found that TiVo HD usability was miles ahead of the already good SARA box in a multitude of rather subtle ways. That\xe2\x80\x99s what UX is to me.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted a lot of folks praising Hydra seem into the eye candy, and while I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for them, personally, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t care.
(All that said, I think Encore is 
Huh. After reading the comments in the 2009 thread, I now understand SARA was the OS running on the SA hardware, and I may thus have had a different OS on my earlier SA DVR.
Whatever it was, my memory is still that is was ugly, but highly functional. And it was well regarded against the CableCo competition in forums I read at time.
While Comcast has some nice feature to offer they are NOT FREE.  I would have to pay for them on monthly basis.  My TIVO already paid for itself and whatever value it holds now can be used to sell on eBay and upgrade to newer model (if I choose to do so) which won\xe2\x80\x99t happen anytime soon since we don\xe2\x80\x99t have 4K TVs.
Chucky, I agree functionality is the priority. But pleasant looks are OK too. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a hundred years, but I remember SARA as being sluggish, laggy. Who knows.
Jakub, Chucky is not on Lifetime\xe2\x80\xa6 so his TiVo features are not free either.
Most of us in this thread have obviously chosen TiVo over the competition, so we probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need to debate that point so intently. With Rovi\xe2\x80\x99s lesser guide data and what at least initially feels like a less intuitive, less efficient interface, what makes TiVo a TiVo. Obviously this is a TiVo product and TiVo has some unique elements, including aforementioned retail availability, but wondering if DVR is mostly a commodity at this point.
nother interesting point \xe2\x80\x93 before CableCARD, a TiVo set-top used IR blasters to control a cable set-top\xe2\x80\xa6 how crazy was that? 
Who here has horror stories about trying to get IR blasters working with a cable box.
Hydra is crap.  The UI is convoluted and all over the place.  Could live with the grid most probably, missing the left button is terrible as well.  Soon as we are caught up on our recordings we must watch.  Will do the factory reset if that does not work wait for the revert app.
I sense this is truly the beginning of the end for Tivo.  So disappointed.
Jeff little harsh review.  I like it, took me less than 5 min to get used to it.  Hmm maybe adding Vox Remote will make it even better or manageable for you.
\n1) single shows are now in a \xe2\x80\x9cgroup\xe2\x80\x9d requiring extra clicks
\n2) PC to Tivo transfers are dead, as are box initiated tivo to tivo transfers. this is just awful and a major step back
\n3) if you are watching a live recording show you must hit pause before exiting or else it goes back to beginning of show when you resume
\n4) if you are in any menu while watching a recorded show it will not stay at current point in show when you exit the menu, it jumps back to when you started to hit menu
\xe2\x80\x9cHmm maybe adding Vox Remote will make it even better or manageable for you.\xe2\x80\x9d
o \xe2\x80\x9cHmm\xe2\x80\x9d necessary. That\xe2\x80\x99s been my working theory for a month now, since 
, that Hydra was intended, and only makes sense as a voice-first UI.
(From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of Hydra, if I wanted a voice-first UI, it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99d be pretty damn dandy. But I want a Peanut-first, voice-second UI. So that\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99m coming from.)
WOW we\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to even have the a grid guide.  It was apparently was included by operator request not subscribers.
here\xe2\x80\x99s even a little chuckle for those that still need it.  We should\xe2\x80\x99ve realized Hydra was going to be a disaster back when Dave posted this in Feb.
Well my attempt to embed a Youtube link didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out so well.  Anyway if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested click on the text above to see the reference where Margret is demoing Hydra live guide.
Jeff was not harsh, im disapointed too. Cant even do a reset all settings. Just goes to the common  big right arrow then after a couple seconds goes to live tv\xe2\x80\xa6
What to watch now is one area that needs improvement. As most of the shows are future shows. Unless you drill down to its sub menus.
Im a techy so i can adapt to it but my wife and kid are having quite the time with it.
Looking forward to getting more solid updates.
Harsh is a matter of opinion. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine letting folks express themselves and certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t force my opinion on others (even if they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong wrong wrong;). Anyhow, my wife is not happy with the new interface and there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance we\xe2\x80\x99ll be rolling back too. Losing recordings will be a kick in the crotch though. I suggested she give it at least a week and also trying the voice remote. But she\xe2\x80\x99s drafting a post and this is what she had to say about my voice remote suggestion
\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I appreciate this option and it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a cool feature, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. If there is technology so advanced that allows me to verbally give directions to a remote control, then we should be able to do so in the same simplistic manner manually as well. While I get that the current trend is to talk to our devices, basic functionality should not be compromised or replaced.\xe2\x80\x9d
orta following onto what Chucky said, I guess her point is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need voice to overcome interface shortcomings? I assume they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to invest the cycles integrating into the prior UI. Will be interesting to see what happens here \xe2\x80\x93 will people really roll back, will others not upgrade, what will MSOs think, how fast will fixes come, will HDUI end up getting voice? A good start would be getting rid of these V66 errors on my Minis\xe2\x80\xa6
ave you should test out Remote Drive.  Not sure if this was tested yet, or mentioned but what if your recordings are on Remote Drive.  When you rollback can you access them with Encore?  Probably not lol, but worth a try.
I certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t roll back. Hydra is a huge improvement over the HDUI. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine going back to using the HDUI now. I only wish they would have updated to Hydra years ago. It has been working great on my Bolts, Roamio, and Mini.
ivo is all about analytics/mining before UX/UI experience anyway.  Of course they needed to update the UI but the Release Candidate we all have now, yes go check your version.  Needs some work.
\xe2\x80\x9cBut (my wife is) drafting a post\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I get that the current trend is to talk to our devices, basic functionality should not be compromised or replaced.\xe2\x80\x9d
You married up, Dave. You married up. She\xe2\x80\x99s a smart cookie.
\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance we\xe2\x80\x99ll be rolling back too. Losing recordings will be a kick in the crotch though\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I upgraded my TiVo, but my hazy recollection is that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as painful as a kick in the crotch. Initiating the KMTTG xfer is quick, and it then runs without user intervention. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall if getting stuff back on en masse was a hassle or not. I keep some a fair bit of HBO stuff, and that was the only real pain, in my hazy recollection.
\xe2\x80\x9cWill be interesting to see what happens here \xe2\x80\x93 will people really roll back, will others not upgrade, what will MSOs think, how fast will fixes come, will HDUI end up getting voice?\xe2\x80\x9d
on\xe2\x80\x99t get my hopes up. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m imagining the upbeat ending of a formulaic Hollywood movie, with crowds wildly cheering as the bad guys are defeated against all odds\xe2\x80\xa6
I tested the rollback from Hydra to the gen3 UI last night and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier.
I keep trying to roll back but \xe2\x80\x9cClear and Delete Everything\xe2\x80\x9d does nothing. Blinks the screen then goes back to the main menu on several roamios I have. The wife and I have been using TabloTV for a week now to not have to use Hydra and Tablo has been great. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just pack all this old Tivo equipment away and look at selling it/ giving it away
Michael, supposedly there is a rollback app somewhere. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t checked yet, been a crazy busy week of little sleep (thanks kid). During one of her naps this weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look for it and ask the wife what she wants to do. As bad as the recent HDUI font update was and losing recordings will be, she may prefer it to Hydra UI and constant TiVo Mini disconnects. And Chucky is right, I should be able to offload and re-populate everything \xe2\x80\x93 maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll start now just in case that\xe2\x80\x99s the move.
1.) Go into Menu- Help- Reset to Defaults- Repeat Guided Setup- Select
\n2.) Press Thumbs Down 2 times (NOT 3!), now press Rewind 2 times, Now press Select (not Enter)
\n3.) The TiVo will immediately go to that right arrow screen, then screen blank, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a message letting you know that the rollback process has begun
You will lose all recordings and settings, etc.
I\xe2\x80\x99m currently in the process of downgrading the box with a whole lot of KMTTG and TiVoPlayList offloading. My Roamio Pro pretty much refuses to work on the network now under Hydra, and going to My Shows with a network connection or pushing down on the main screen crashes the interface. 20 reboots since 9pm last night. I have no patience to wait for an update right now and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it again in February.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\xa6 ask the wife what she wants to do. As bad as the recent HDUI font update was and losing recordings will be, she may prefer it to Hydra UI and constant TiVo Mini disconnects.\xe2\x80\x9d
I fully understand that Hydra is currently buggy to the point of being unusable.
But I do still hope your wife posts her thoughts on what she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like about Hydra 
. (I have many ideas of what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not about to upgrade simply to get myself a first hand look.)
I did the UI reset recommended in the forums.  Thumbs down, thumbs up, play, play.  Got rid of the V66 on both my mini\xe2\x80\x99s.  For now, at least.
Chucky, her main issues are the interface is not intuitive, seems like it requires more clicks to find recordings, the grid guide is old school (her words), lack of contrast in grid guide and thin fonts are visually challenging. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some complaints too \xe2\x80\x93 they could have used a similar paradigm here without neutering the peanut when in video. Right select to pull up a list of tuners is worthless \xe2\x80\x93 how about using it to bring up info banner or the new favorite channels list, freeing up the left select to do what it\xe2\x80\x99s always done. 
I\xe2\x80\x9dm hearing there\xe2\x80\x99s a V66 patch in testing now. But we may end up rolling back before it hits. kmttg wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cooperating this weekend, so we may just go inbox zero here\xe2\x80\xa6 wife decides, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.
I thought Hydra was very intuitive. I just need to unlearn the way I used the old interface for so long. I\xe2\x80\x99m just about there now.
In my setups, KMTTG has been working great. It\xe2\x80\x99s been transferring all my shows daily, like normal, from my Bolts and Roamio on Hydra. Although I run KMTTG as a service, on a PC dedicated to my TiVos recordings.
My only complaint recently was that I got Blue circles on a day or two last week. But that also affected boxes running the old OS as well(from what I read at TiVo community). Which really isn\xe2\x80\x99t a complaint with Hydra, but with the TiVo service itself.
I am really loving Hydra on my TiVos. It has been so much better to me than the old UI.
ot intuitive is definitely a good way to describe it. 
o echo Dave and Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on the voice first UI, it seems they didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn the lessons Microsoft is supposedly learning with the Xbox. They designed the UI of the Xbox One originally apparently around having the Kinect and voice something they now no longer make. Recent updates are supposed to have address the earlier navigation issues. 
For me some of what makes a TiVo is being able to offload and upload recordings. With Hydra we have now lost both functions. Accurate recordings with Rovi isn\xe2\x80\x99t the experience it once was. While I haven\xe2\x80\x99t downgraded, I have moved Hydra into the spare bedroom and moved my Bolt which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t upgrade to the main living room.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve also downgraded my Roamio (base being used as OTA), so that I can watch all off both on the old UI.  I am keeping Hydra on 6 tuner cable so I can monitor the tweaking.  That back button placement makes it so difficult to navigate, as I mostly watch recorded shows and like to switch between the two Now Playing lists (My Shows).
I have no issues offloading my recordings from my Hydra PCs. Using KMTTG or pyTiVo Desktop still works great for TiVo to PC transfers. The issue is that with Hydra you no longer have PC to Tivo transfers.
o far, not so good for me.  My guide consistently displays all channels, even though I have edited it and it still shows as edited.  That\xe2\x80\x99s really annoying.  It frequently looses guide data and transitioning is very slow with that spinning circle appearing all the time.  I really wanted a voice remote, but I\xe2\x80\x99m considering going back to the old UI.  Really disappointing.
Is there a \xe2\x80\x9cHow to navigate Hydra with legacy Tivo remote\xe2\x80\x9d tutorial out there? Hopefully Tivo would produce one. I found the Zoom as Back inconsistent in different places. (Last seems a better Back replacement).
hought I\xe2\x80\x99d throw out my cautionary tale but my guess is that people won\xe2\x80\x99t see this until after the fact. My kid broke the Tivo remote on our Roamio Pro so I decided to get the new voice remote for a little more as I thought it might be cool to have voice.  So I paired the remote and then tried to use voice when it told me to update to the new interface.  So I ran the Update and rebooted right before we left for dinner.  When we came in after dinner, I was quite surprised at the interface change as I knew nothing of \xe2\x80\x9cHydra\xe2\x80\x9d previously and I must say my wife and I\xe2\x80\x98s first impression wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very flattering. I recently tried PlayStation Vue \xe2\x80\x9ccable\xe2\x80\x9d and the tiles reminded me of that and again, not impressed.  And then we saw the guide and it reminded me of PlayStation Vue and again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impressed.
gain, this is just a quick review and I will share my thoughts further in the days and weeks ahead but I really have to say I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty upset at the situation for a gimmicky feature such as voice(initial thinking when I ordered the remote).  No offense but when voice would come in most handy is when I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the remote in my hand, which is how we use Alexa.  And to think that the only way to go back requires us to lose all of our recordings and I honestly have to start questioning my investment in Tivo though the Roamio Pro and several Minis are on lifetime.  Then again, after my initial reaction to the new interface, I have to wonder if the Tivo Lifetime systems will continue to retain their value.
I should add that I\xe2\x80\x99m in technology and use Windows 10 and am generally in favor of trying new systems and interfaces.  Even though I\xe2\x80\x99m not a developer, I have done some development in the past and the interface was always important to me whether that were with the mouse or keyboard (apps with the tab fields out of order always drove me crazy).  Although my previous post seemed focused on the look, which will take some getting used to, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Tivo changed the 4-way navigation so drastically.  No longer being able to go back feels like Microsoft removing the Ctrl-C shortcut from Windows.  Just seems drastic and jarring for some reason and I hope I intuit why they made that change as I use the interface.  But right now I\xe2\x80\x99m just shaking my head at the various negative surprises I keep running into with what so far seems like such little gain.
How do I cycle through the different tuners on the new interface?
ight Arrow when watching live TV. Should give you list of different tuners and what they are on.  I think on BOLT it will actually play video of each tuner.
o video. It just shows the channel and picture/icon of the show that is on the other tuner.

, that re-envisions the TiVo experience upon a modern, extensible platform. And should you be primed and ready to go, 
iVo Consumer VP Ted Malone has provided details
On Sunday morning, you will be able to go to a page on the\xc2\xa0TiVo\xc2\xa0website and request the upgrade for any TSN that is on your account. While not technically \xe2\x80\x9cforever\xe2\x80\x9d, you will need to wait 2-3 hours before forcing a call to download the new software.
However, before you take the plunge, there are some things you should know\xe2\x80\xa6
espite the extensive gestation period, including the incorporation of Fan TV talent and\xc2\xa0
, Hydra remains a work in progress. Folks who lived with the prior interfaces for years upon years should be prepared for a shock to the system. Not to say the experience isn\xe2\x80\x99t good, but it\xe2\x80\x99s dramatically different and not yet complete. 
nd one feature in particular power users need to be alerted to: PC-
, etc) are not yet operational. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe this is an intentional EOL event. Rather, there was work prioritized ahead of this more niche functionality and the retrofitting of likely archaic hooks. However, transferring recordings from various TiVo 
\xc2\xa0to Hydra boxes works (via TiVo.com, versus STB initiation) as does\xc2\xa0
) while TiVo pushed their supposedly superior solution and 
Owners of first generation TiVo Minis should be aware they lack the interface\xe2\x80\x99s critical \xe2\x80\x98back\xe2\x80\x99 remote control button. The \xe2\x80\x98zoom\xe2\x80\x99 button will act as a stand-in should you be prepared to move forward with Hydra without committing to the purchase of a new remote.
hould you update to Hydra and later change your mind (or someone in your household changes it for you), you can revert back. However, it requires a complete factory reset \xe2\x80\xa6 and lose of all your recordings.
In any event, I expect several updates over the next few weeks ironing out any last-minute bugs before the team gets to work on more significant refinement based on our feedback and what I assume is an extensive roadmap.

If you\xe2\x80\x99re running 20.7.4 and pick up a TiVo Vox voice remote, clicking the blue voice button will also initiate the Hydra update. 
ed shipped me a 4K Mini Vox that should arrive Monday, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how quickly I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to blogging. Between the day job, new home, and toddler, I have limited time and energy. :) Best bet for more timely updates is to 
Been testing it for weeks. Still *very* buggy but that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop them from going ahead with it. Other testers are dumbfounded that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to release it so soon. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend waiting a month or two before anyone installs it.
he consumer electronics space has many challenging elements \xe2\x80\x93 and one is you gotta get hardware out for holiday sales, Best Buy shelf reset, along with the new packaging, etc. All this stuff is coordinated months ahead of time. Which means sometimes incomplete software tags along. 
his isn\xe2\x80\x99t specific to TiVo. Although their track record hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been inspiring. For Premiere, they chose to hold back hardware because the HDUI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready, skipped the critical holiday sales season, and still released a beta, incomplete, optional HDUI when they launched hardware the next spring. And that was a very costly delay and decision in my estimation. 
I\xe2\x80\x99m good with, support the recommendation to hang back \xe2\x80\x94 if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so gung ho to test the voice functionality, I\xe2\x80\x99d be waiting too. Hopefully my wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me.
PC to TiVo transfers aren\xe2\x80\x99t operational, but are TiVo to PC transfers operational? I\xe2\x80\x99ve succumb to the practice of transferring to my PC and loading shows into PLEX.
Yes, you can offload recordings under Hydra. The scenario I presented is something of corner case in my opinion, but an associate felt strongly it should be shared.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the two column love guide.  That\xe2\x80\x99s all I use.
Forcing a complete box reset on downgrade is just stupid, recordings should NEVER be trashed.  I get that metadata might be different but the actual streams written to disk should be usable no matter what.
\nYeah I wonder about that. Is it a choice intended to dissuade downgrades or was just easier to program/accommodate given probably more pressing development priorities? I have my suspicions. Hm.
Well I was planning on forcing the connection on Sunday but hearing about all bugs and issues I am having second thoughts.  I am bit shocked that there are still so many bugs especially since this thing have been in development for years and Demo from Feb looked pretty good.  I know those things can be pre-recorded for ultimate results but still.  One thing when it comes to software development bad cost cutting/restructuring (that TiVo went through with merger/acquisition) QA always goes first or becomes the cost saving place.  Then companies have to pay for it with Buggy Software.  Ok enough with ranting, I am excited for Hydra and hoping that Software Updates don\xe2\x80\x99t take 10 years like they did with previous UI.
I believe it is to keep people from downgrading, as the file formats used and the metadata should not change.   It may be because of some sort of file system change or something else, but seems odd.   Does the upgrade require a certain amount of space free on the TiVo rider to upgrade, or can it do so with a nearly 100% full drive?
I still plan on upgrasding one of my Boltd to test Hydra out. But it will not be mu primary TiVo. Ill try it out first before I decide to upgrade my other Bolts, Roamio, and Mini.
I do have a voice remote comiing from Amazon. Which should hopefully show up on Tuesday.
hanks for describing the shortcomings of the new interface, because it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a reason that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be delaying the upgrade as long as possible.
I also much prefer the live guide to any grid guides.  I have used grids before, and while they are more common, they don\xe2\x80\x99t given enough data for a given channel (but much more info for a given time slot).  The live guide is what set Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s Guide experience apart from other DVRs, and it seems backwards to me that they drop that and keep only the grid.  I understand keeping the grid for the cable operators, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t get dropping the live guide option.
Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using the live guide for what seems like forever. The grid guide only seems useful if you are watching live tv with channels grouped together. But I only watch recordings. And when I check the guide, I want to see what is on many hours ahead. Not 1.5 to 2 hours ahead, like the grid guide only shows.
Big thanks to TiVo for making this change optional.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll just relax and enjoy my TV while the rest of you stress out over this.  I may take the plunge in a few months if you guys report that it is safe.
Me either Bricketh. I loved the live for the same reason. I found the live guide far superior.
aaronwt, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that your Mini will want to have the same UI as whichever DVR it connects to\xe2\x80\xa6 so if you have a Mini flipping between a Bolt with Hydra and a Roamio with Encore, it could be ugly with continual prompts to change.
\xe2\x80\x9caaronwt, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that your Mini will want to have the same UI as whichever DVR it connects to\xe2\x80\xa6 so if you have a Mini flipping between a Bolt with Hydra and a Roamio with Encore, it could be ugly with continual prompts to change.\xe2\x80\x9d
From my vague memory of a reading of the TCF thread a couple of days ago, I thought it was worse than just continual prompts. I thought a Mini simply won\xe2\x80\x99t work with a DVR on a different UI. But I could well be wrong.
I read it the same way as Chucky\xe2\x80\xa6   if you attempt to connect to the newer UI from a older UI Mini, it will prompt to update, and vice versa.   I\xe2\x80\x99d imagine it is not a quick process to revert on the Mini, with minimally 2 reboots during the process (which take 3-5 minutes for the Mini 2).  
hat said, I am expecting that is what Dave meant, when trying to go back and forth between the two units.
Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve confused quite a few people today on multiple points. I\xe2\x80\x99m so Twitter-concise, I can no longer be understood. :) The way I understand it, if the Mini doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match the host DVR, it\xe2\x80\x99ll prompt to upgrade or downgrade to become operable.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so Twitter-concise, I can no longer be understood.\xe2\x80\x9d
amn. I\xe2\x80\x99m dreading 280 characters as a reader, but I guess you should be dreading it as a tweeter\xe2\x80\xa6
t least he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end all of his blog posts with hashtags.
sounds like we are going to be in for a long but hopefully fun ride!
hat sucks that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just upgrade a mini on it\xe2\x80\x99s own and not the host box. Would allow many to test out the new interface without having to destroy all our recordings if we change are minds since no recordings are on the mini\xe2\x80\x99s.
arly upgrade form is here. Will update post to reflect later. 
Can\xe2\x80\x99t yet tell you it works. Or works without issue. Should know in a few hours. 
nd I guess I missed where the Mini Vox comes with Encore u til it connects to a Hydra Tivo\xe2\x80\xa6   I figured that\xe2\x80\x99d be my loophole.
I posted this on TCF, but posting here too, in case someone has this experience to share.  
If anyone is using Hydra on a Roamio (plus or pro) please post your thoughts on the performance, including snappiness of the UI.
on-scientifically, moving through UI, animations, in/out of live TV all real smooth and efficient. Apps still to slow to load but can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s same, better, worse. 
on\xe2\x80\x99t upgrade yet if you have Minis. They\xe2\x80\x99re getting stuck in a loop and want the definitive self help steps to correct or TiVo to fix on their end before encouraging folks. 
Ok both my minis are updated. Power cycled, quickly forced a connection, walked away for 20 minutes, power cycled again. Will try to cover during daughter\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon nap. 
I am too weak, just opted into New Hydra Experience.  Now I wait 2-3 hours before I force my connection to TIVO.  If I find any issues will post here and on 
Wow, no pc to TiVo (i.e. pytivo). Any hints as to when that might arrive?
lso curious what other solutions for PC to TiVo transfer folks are using. Is Plex what all the kids are using these days?  Something else?
Oh and is Plex working on the new UI?
I updated the post \xe2\x80\x93 folks with older, first generation TiVo Minis should be aware those older remotes do not have a \xe2\x80\x98back\xe2\x80\x99 button and the left directional button no longer send you back\xe2\x80\xa6 Zoom button will perform the same function. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any 1st gen Minis, but even so it\xe2\x80\x99s still going to take some retraining.
I have a first gen Mini but I use a newer remote with it since I use the RF dongle. I plan on upgrading it shortly. Actually after spending some time with the new OS, I am even upgrading my main Tivo. Overall I really like Hydra.
I just tried Plex on my Bolt with Hydra. It seems to be working fine.
But I\xe2\x80\x99m also not a big user of Plex. I set up PLex on my TiVo PC and another one as a test. But the things I looked at in PLEX from teh Hydra Bolt, were working like before the Hydra update..
Hydra is a truly horrible grey and drab user experience that discards Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLive guide\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 one of the things that set the device apart from cable provider interfaces. A user interface that is totally non-intuitive. And I was the dummy that dove in not realizing I can\xe2\x80\x99t roll back without losing my programs.
oamio and 2 minis updated. Roamio upgrade was clean. The minis hung for 90 minutes. I rebooted roamio (pulled plug) then did same for minis and all are updated now.  So far I like it but just getting started.
You know the upgrade isn\xe2\x80\x99t being sought by the masses when you can\xe2\x80\x99t find a single video on YouTube of the interface in action on the first day of release.
\nWhich is a trainwreck of a youtube video \xe2\x80\x93 so many things going on that begs questions, and so many things to notice\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9dIs that a hamster ball?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he just reading a press release?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat spread is she putting on that bagel?\xe2\x80\x9d
Just to be clear, I can choose not to upgrade and keep my Live Guide forever??
o idea about forever. But it is an Opt In upgrade.
I liked the Hydra UI so much, I updated all my TiVos to it today. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the old UI. Now while I will miss the Live Guide that I used for over fifteen years, the changes that Hydra brings are worth losing it to me.
\xe2\x80\x9cI liked the Hydra UI so much, I updated all my TiVos to it today. It\xe2\x80\x99s so much better than the old UI.\xe2\x80\x9d
Can you describe or list what you like about Hydra, aaronwt? Genuinely curious.
veryone should sit down for this one, but at a certain point, the Sun will expand to engulf the Earth, and there are serious doubts Encore will still function properly then.
I like the more modern interface. I really, really like the Episode strip when viewing your records or shows you have from your One Passes.. And then you can quickly and easily see the actors and the names of the characters they play when you drill down into more info. The larger preview window is great. Larger Fonts. It\xe2\x80\x99s been quick and snappier from all my TiVos. They even have a list for paused shows. Off the top of my head those came to mind.
Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect and no UI ever has been. But for their first iteration I am pleased with it. And have not run into any bugs yet that I would consider show stoppers.
\nFortunately, in my setups, I have not run into anything that has cause me issues with my primary use for my TiVos. Which is being able to see and hear my recordings when watching them.
eems that the Roamio voice remote is out of stock. Or not released yet? Unsure.
My Vox remote, without dongle, is supposed to ship today from Amazon.
Is there a way to make sure I never get this update?
o. Right now it is Opt In. But there is no guarantee, that at some point in the the future, they push it out with no choice to the user..
I just know that I am glad I upgraded to Hydra. Now I just need to convince my GF to do it. It took her awhile to update to the HDUI. So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will take her awhile to update to Hydra.
Quick question \xe2\x80\x93 anyone else reporting that old slide remotes are no longer working with the RF dongles w/ gen1/2 Minis?  Mine stopped working and not sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s my hardware, or a larger phenomenon
xactly what is the URL for this site? \xe2\x80\x9cgo to a page on the TiVo website and request the upgrade for any TSN that is on your account\xe2\x80\x9d
My RF dongle on my Gen 1 Mini is still working fine. I am using a Bolt remote with it. It works like it did before Hydra in RF mode. So far everything been running great with Hydra on my Bolts, Roamio, and Mini.
Has anyone actually tried pyTiVo after installing Hydra?  I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the behavior is.  Wondering if the \xe2\x80\x9cDevices\xe2\x80\x9d item just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show / doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an equivalent? Or is it maybe an issue in pyTiVo itself?  If it is with pyTiVo I want to try to get with the pyTiVo folks and see if there is a fix possible over there.
I just have a Tivo Bolt + (older version) and just received a TiVo Vox remote that I had ordered, but before I install it I had a couple of questions.  I was wondering if the guide still has the filter option.  When I am trying to find the channel for a sports game I will usually filter the guide so it only shows Sports (you can do the same for movies).  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard if that feature has been added.  One thing I read said that the voice activation had trouble finding sports events for example if you say \xe2\x80\x9cwatch the World Series\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwatch the Bruins.\xe2\x80\x9d  
Have they actually released the hardware specs for the Tivo Bolt VOX?  A couple of articles that I read said that the Tivo Bolt Vox is the same hardware as the older Tivo Bolt + but where are they getting this information from?  There is an article written from the Verge that may be the source of this information.  It said that it looks the same, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the actual processor or memory and the hardware specs on the Tivo site don\xe2\x80\x99t mention those specs.  Not sure if they are getting this information from Tivo directly or if they have more specific info that they did not release.  I was just wondering if there had been any upgrade to the processor or memory (I understand its the same number of tuners and HD space) since I had just bought the Bolt + just weeks before the Vox was released.   
iVo VP Ted Malone told me the Bolt hardware is the same, which I suspect is the case for all the parts that matter. But he\xe2\x80\x99s new on the job and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done a teardown, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t independently confirm.
Ok thanks Dave, if the Vice President told you \xe2\x80\x93 I take his word!  Thanks
I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about ditching Directv because the new Genie GUI software update is horrible and I always found Tivo\xe2\x80\x99s GUI to be superior.  One thing though that I noticed on a Youtube run through of the Hydra interface is that the progress bar now casts a dark shadow at the bottom of the screen.  This is one of the things that Directv changed in the software update and it is a change for the worse.  Is there any way to lessen the footprint of the progress bar on the Hydra interface?
Been running Hydra for a little while now.  The new UI/UX is not to my taste (yes, it *looks* great, but it is very unintuitive), but that\xe2\x80\x99s a subjective thing.  
he bigger issue is that this software is seriously buggy!  Channels disappear, Sound has issues, It tells you the latest connection succeeded when it has failed for 3 days straight.
But the biggest issue \xe2\x80\x93 Shows are often not recorded:  I verified via the To Do list that an upcoming football game is scheduled to record and came back at what I hoped would be halftime and found the game wasn\xe2\x80\x99t recorded!  This has happened on multiple occasions.  This should be the bare minimum that a DVR can do.
I advise everyone wait at least a couple of releases before \xe2\x80\x98upgrading\xe2\x80\x99 to Hydra.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no shows fail to record since I upgraded to Hydra eight days ago. And I have over 200 One Passes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also had zero audio issues with Hydra. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve not noticed any channels disappearing from my OTA TiVos or my TiVos on FiOS.
I have a One Pass to record every NFL game broadcast. It recorded them all as normal since upgrading to Hydra.
Over 200 One Passes ? Wow. I bow to The Master :)
o it seems I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a pretty significant problem in the Hydra upgrade that they\xe2\x80\x99re not drawing attention to. However, customer service was aware and the fix is\xe2\x80\xa6 well pretty easy.
I have parental controls set. After the Hydra upgrade, none of my saved recordings would play. They all come up with an error indicating that they can\xe2\x80\x99t be played, and refer me to error P103 (tivo.com/help/p103). If you look at the details it shows this error relates to Parental Controls.
Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right \xe2\x80\x93 all my previous recordings won\xe2\x80\x99t play because they are protected by parental controls \xe2\x80\x93 and the system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prompt for the parental controls pin. The easy workaround is to either disable parental controls, or just unlock it for 4 hours with the menu.
I, too discovered the Parental Controls issue but none of my shows would play \xe2\x80\x93 even the ones that passed the Parental Controls restriction.  Someone in the forums suggested disabling PC and it worked, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a totally unacceptable glitch.  This is a system that is designed to know the patterns of those watching \xe2\x80\x93 for instance, kid shows are supposed to be displayed during kid hours, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not smart enough to operate with parental controls enabled.  How this was not discovered before rollout is beyond me.
What I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised the most by now is the fact that there is no bug report system for Hydra. (Is there?) Aside from a disgusting thread on TCF, I see no place to submit that P103 bug so they can track and resolve it.
@Dave Zatz do you know of some backchannel bug report form?
I bought the new remote and upgraded, I have a roamio pro. I have been with TiVo since the first tivos, I love TiVo but HATE this update, I would give anything to be able to downgrade back to the old version but keep all my shows and settings and have it like it was, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the voice remote but need the old experience, I hate this one.
I\xe2\x80\x99m in the same position as you\xe2\x80\xa6have a TiVo Pro and bought a new Vox Remote. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken the plunge yet though with the upgrade. The kids and I have watched video demonstrations of it on YouTube. The kids like the look of it. I do too. However, I\xe2\x80\x99m ultimately nervous about it. 
Please help! What do you not like about it? Why would you like to switch back? What are the specific things you don\xe2\x80\x99t like? (I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose my shows, if I want to revert back. I have multiple seasons of multiple shows) 
hanks in advance! Your input is appreciated\xe2\x80\xa6
We\xe2\x80\x99d like to switch back too\xe2\x80\xa6 losing all recordings would suck and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having luck offloading to computer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have much time to mess with it.
Why? What don\xe2\x80\x99t y\xe2\x80\x99all like about it\xe2\x80\xa6to the point that you want to switch back?
oes anyone reading this \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 the Hydra interface?
I like the interface fine though I could provide a long list of improvements they could make. As a software developer I would love to be able to look at the code.
\nMy Roamio OTA works pretty well and the interface is fast. My only frequently recurring problem is the Guide tells me I have no channels selected. I can fix it by going into the Channel List and adding then removing a channel, go back Live and it works. This happens many times a day.

"TiVo's new interface will cut down on channel surfing"
10:30am
, and that it would be adopting its name. Now, TiVo has announced updates to its user interface.
he company is trying to adapt to the changing world of viewing habits by working with smart TVs and mobile devices. The new interface will bring in a wider range of content from traditional television networks and online sources. In addition to that it will help predict what viewers want to watch based on their viewing history, what device they\xe2\x80\x99re watching on, and at what time.
"Finding what you want to watch has become increasingly difficult with the growing number of video providers," TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s chief design officer, Margret Schmidt,\xc2\xa0

iVo Nearing Wider Deployment of \xe2\x80\x98Project Hydra\xe2\x80\x99 UI
eeking consumers to try out its new interface
6/09/2017
If a move toward field trials offers any indication, TiVo appears to be inching toward the wider rollout of a new user interface code-named \xe2\x80\x9cProject Hydra.\xe2\x80\x9d
Margaret Schmidt, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s chief design officer and vice president of product development, recently tweeted that the company was seeking people to try it out, directing them to a 
 TiVo official confirmed that this is for a beta trial of the Project Hydra user interface. Vodafone Espa\xc3\xb1a was the 
iVo has not announced a date for the wider launch and expanded availability of the new UI, but the beta test site notes that TiVo is targeting a new software release for \xe2\x80\x9clate 2017.\xe2\x80\x9d
Gadget blogger Dave Zatz points out that the release timing is far behind the original schedule:\xc2\xa0
Late 2017 only puts it one year behind schedule. ;) 
iVo presented some details on its redesigned and streamlined interface in February, noting that operators will have the ability to customize it with their branding and through the use of different colors. It will offer a more unified look and feel across different devices.
lso included is something Schmidt refers to as a \xe2\x80\x9ctrade-up experience\xe2\x80\x9d in which the viewer can use the arrow keys to drill down into content. Clicking right shows what programming the other tuners on the box is pulling in, left pulls up the user\xe2\x80\x99s favorite channels, down presents the prediction strip, and up offers a presentation of what\xe2\x80\x99s on different channels, including what\xe2\x80\x99s on now and what\xe2\x80\x99s coming next.
he new UI also borrows a page from TV\xe2\x80\x99s past with support for a standard grid guide, an option that Sling TV recently added to its interface.

You might still think of TiVo as a DVR company, but this year a different strategy is starting to emerge. TiVo didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any consumer hardware to CES 2017; instead, the company showed off a brand-new TiVo interface\xe2\x80\x94first announced last September\xe2\x80\x94that tries to predict what you might watch based on past viewing patterns.
hat new interface should become available for the entire TiVo customer base this year, says Paul Stathacopoulos, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of strategy. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t just be for DVR boxes. It can also run on Android, paving the way for new streaming devices with TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations, browsing experience, and search on top.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on software, rather than hardware, at CES shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a huge surprise. Last year, TiVo was acquired by Rovi, a company that licenses TV-guide data, metadata, and other intellectual property related to video. (The combined entity is now called TiVo Corp.) Around the time of acquisition, Rovi said it 
he new interface, codenamed \xe2\x80\x9cHydra,\xe2\x80\x9d is part of that proposition. Beyond just looking slicker and being less cluttered than the current TiVo interface, it puts a big emphasis on personalized recommendations, appearing for instance as image thumbnails on the home screen. That prediction engine is powered by DigitalSmiths, a firm that 
, and it draws on users\xe2\x80\x99 past behavior. Stathacopoulos says that in testing, users select one of these predictions 60 percent of the time on average for weekday viewing, and 40 percent of the time on weekends.
tathacopoulos says the new interface is in \xe2\x80\x9cfinal qualification\xe2\x80\x9d and should become available to existing TiVo customers in 2017. The upgrade will be optional, but users won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to downgrade once they\xe2\x80\x99ve moved to the new interface.
Perhaps just as interesting as the new interface itself is where it might end up. Stathacopoulos says the interface is capable of running as an Android application.
iVo wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually demonstrating the Android version of its interface at CES, nor did the company reveal any specific plans, so we can only speculate on what might happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine a streaming set-top box that launches into the TiVo interface and combines content from streaming sources such as Netflix and Hulu along with over-the-air broadcasts from an antenna. (Dish Network just launched something similar with 
, a box that combines antenna channels, Sling TV channels, and Netflix recommendations into a unified interface.)
Going the Android route could help TiVo overcome the limited streaming app support on its own platform. Although TiVo integrates with some major services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Go, and offers some additional apps from the Opera TV store, several major streaming services are missing from the platform, including Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, Showtime, Starz, and the vast majority of 
Hardware vendors might be much more interested in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s prediction-driven interface if it can piggyback on the larger Android ecosystem. But until we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen some hardware announcements, all of this remains theoretical.

iVo Roamio OTA review: It feels like going back in time
iVo Bolt review: The best DVR gets better
s time goes by,\xc2\xa0 TiVo gets harder to love.\xc2\xa0The cable-box DVRs for which TiVo serves as an alternative are becoming more sophisticated, with modern interfaces, voice search, and built-in streaming apps. Forgoing cable entirely is also getting easier, thanks to a proliferation of streaming services and new over-the-air DVR solutions. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s consumer hardware business is getting squeezed from both directions.
he TiVo Bolt Vox is an attempt to push back. Like the existing TiVo Bolt, the Vox serves as either a DVR for cable subscribers or a way to record free over-the-air channels from an antenna. Its main addition is a new remote with voice search, and it also ships with a long-awaited software overhaul. (Existing TiVo Bolt and Roamio owners can upgrade to the new software for free, and buy the voice remote for $45.)
But while TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s recording capabilities are still second-to-none, and its integration with streaming services is still a clever idea, the Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s additions only paper over deficiencies in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app platform and hardware. Despite the new software and voice search, using a TiVo Bolt Vox still feels like stepping back into a bygone era.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has the same design as the old Bolt, with a rectangular enclosure that arches updward on one side. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a coaxial input, HDMI output, optical audio output, 3.5mm audio jack, e-SATA storage port, and two USB ports. (The USB ports don\xe2\x80\x99t support external DVR storage, and the only e-SATA drive that works with TiVo sells at a huge markup.) A hatch underneath the Bolt Vox houses a CableCARD slot.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has every conceivable port you might need.
iVo is selling three versions of the Bolt Vox. The 500GB model and 1TB models both have four tuners and cost $200 and $300 respectively. The 3TB model has 6 tuners for $500, but it only works with cable, not over-the-air broadcasts.
In all cases, TiVo charges $15 per month or $150 per year for DVR service. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lifetime service option for $550, which is on top of the cost of hardware.
If you want to use TiVo as a whole-home DVR, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Mini or Mini Vox satellite units, which costs $150 and $180 respectively. The latter comes with the same voice remote as the Bolt Vox, and it supports 4K video. The Tivo Bolt Vox can stream live and recorded TV to iOS and Android devices at no extra charge. (There\xe2\x80\x99s also a beta app for Fire TV devices, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been updated in two years and only works with recorded programs.)
One thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice with the TiVo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x94at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting out in the open\xe2\x80\x94is that it\xe2\x80\x99s constantly whirring. Noise emanates from the unit whether it\xe2\x80\x99s recording or not, whether the TV is on or off, and strangely even when the TiVo itself is on standby. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a major nuisance, especially from 10 feet away, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of how unobtrusive fanless streaming boxes and sticks are by comparison.
One might say the same of the TiVo Bolt Vox remote, which remains a hefty tool loaded with buttons, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99ll seldom press. The main differences from the regular Bolt remote are the new voice search button (more on that later), a Netflix button, and a dedicated button for TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s existing ad-skipping feature. Cable subscribers will likely feel at home with the setup; but again, those who\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to streaming players like Roku and Apple TV may recoil at the remote\xe2\x80\x99s chunkiness.
he Tivo Bolt Vox remote borrows more from cable boxes than modern streaming devices.
he Tivo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s biggest new feature is its software, previously codenamed \xe2\x80\x9cHydra\xe2\x80\x9d and now just known as the New User Interface. It\xe2\x80\x99s pre-loaded on the Bolt Vox, but existing TiVo owners have the option to upgrade as well.
iVo has given its UI some much-needed streamlining.
he new software strikes a more modern look, trading rounded rectangles and color gradients for sharp edges and solid colors. It\xe2\x80\x99s also more visual, often letting you scroll through thumbnail images instead of plain text.
More importantly, it provides a much-needed streamlining to the menu system. The main menu now has three content sections\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Shows\xe2\x80\x9d for recordings, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d for recommendations, and a launcher for third-party apps\xe2\x80\x94plus a search function and a settings menu. The What to Watch menu is especially useful, creating a unified TV guide out of various channels and streaming services. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a strip of quick recommendations at the bottom of the screen, based on what TiVo thinks you might like.
he \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d menu pulls upcoming programs, recordings, and streaming video into one handy guide.
Voice commands are helpful too, letting you jump around the menu system and search for titles, actors, and directors. The remote seldom failed to understand me, and search supports complex queries like \xe2\x80\x9c80\xe2\x80\x99s comedies\xe2\x80\x9d and follow-up questions like \xe2\x80\x9cJust the ones with Rick Moranis.\xe2\x80\x9d You can even filter the results to only show content from Netflix, Amazon, or Vudu. The only downsides are that search doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with all streaming services\xe2\x80\x94HBO Go is a major omission\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t search from inside a third-party app.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search is accurate, and understands complex queries.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s software still has some rough patches. Transitions and animations tend to be choppy compared to modern streaming boxes, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon menu concept\xe2\x80\x94in which rows of image thumbnails appear as you scroll through a column of menu text\xe2\x80\x94can be disorienting compared to fully image-driven apps like Netflix. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no apparent way to browse shows by genre while filtering out results from streaming services. And most annoyingly of all, TiVo always reverts to playing live TV when it\xe2\x80\x99s left alone in a menu for too long. It really ought to revert to standby mode instead.
Beyond those gripes, I imagine some TiVo enthusiasts will be dissatisfied with design changes in general, and with some particular things like the replacement of the 
It\xe2\x80\x99s all the more tragic, then, that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s streaming app support is still lacking.
lthough TiVo offers most of the basic streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any streaming channel bundles, which cord-cutters might want to supplement over-the-air channels. The platform has MLB T V, but not NBA League Pass or NHL TV. CBS News lacks the live anchored coverage that\xe2\x80\x99s offered on other platforms, and neat new streaming apps like Pluto TV and Hoopla are also absent. Aside from HBO Go, pretty much every TV Everywhere app is missing from TiVO as well. A fresh coat of paint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app catalog is stagnant.
You know an app platform has problems when Flixfling and Ameba are near the top of the list.
he TiVo Bolt Vot is still a great DVR at its core. It allows users to get granular with their recording preferences, for instance by keeping only a certain number of recent episodes, avoiding recordings in standard definition, and customizing start and stop buffer times. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to weed out scheduling conflicts through a dedicated menu, and with four tuners in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s base models, conflicts should be rare to begin with. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s OnePass feature, which lets you view recorded and streaming episodes of a show from a single view, remains a nice touch as well.
But without a vibrant app scene, the TiVo Bolt Vox still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as an all-in-one entertainment box for the streaming age. Cord-cutters in search of consolidation should instead look to 
a decent option for a single television
, provided you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind switching inputs when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stream.
he TiVo Bolt Vox will mainly appeal to diehard cable subscribers who might not mind the investment in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s hardware and services. But as more people give up cable TV in favor of antenna channels and streaming services, the squeeze on TiVo seems unlikely to let up.

iVo has overhauled the user interface of its Virgin Media TV platform for the first time in around four years.
s well as extensive visual enhancements, the update introduces improved recommendations and content discovery services.
he menu structures have been redesigned to aid navigation, while the classic red background has made way for a plum colour scheme with refined fonts.
he Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) retains its grid layout, but now lets users move backwards through the listings and watch shows that have already aired on-demand.
"TiVo has placed emphasis on content discovery and will now recommend shows based on the user's viewing habits, and even automatically download them in the background."
 predictive search function has also been introduced, and downloaded content will be arranged into categories, such as Kids, Movies, and TV & Radio.
Under-the-hood refinements will ensure that TiVo runs quicker and offers higher-resolution imagery, and the flash-based apps it currently uses are being phased out in favour of HTML5-powered services.
More apps will also be available to TiVo customers thanks to an agreement between Virgin and Opera, which is integrating its app store into the platform.
he update will begin its rollout next month, and is expected to reach all customers by the end of the year.
Virgin Media has also updated its TV Anywhere mobile service to bring it in line with the new TiVo.

iVo is nearing the launch of a new product in its BOLT family of DVRs, which can either be 
\xc2\xa0in place of your cable company\xe2\x80\x99s DVR, or, in the case of the 
, be used by cord cutters who want a way to record over-the-air broadcasts. Now, ahead of any official announcement, a new BOLT product is appearing on Amazon, called the BOLT VOX. The device comes with a new voice remote control and supports 4K, like the earlier BOLT models.
Why hello there unannounced TiVo Bolt Vox!  Bundled voice remote and Hydra interface. 
t 500GB, that\xe2\x80\x99s comparable to the entry-level BOLT, which is also available in a 1TB version. The BOLT+, meanwhile, offers 3T of storage. Given the BOLT VOX\xe2\x80\x99s support for 4K, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear there will need to be more storage tiers offered here.
ccording to Zatz, that will be the case. He 
Like the other BOLT products, the new DVR combines the ability to watch and record from traditional TV, as well as watch via streaming services. This is one of the key selling features for the TiVo BOLT and BOLT+. They\xe2\x80\x99re designed for those who want to combine their traditional TV viewing \xe2\x80\x93 whether via cable or broadcast \xe2\x80\x93 with online streaming from services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Vudu, HBO, Epix, YouTube, and others.
But what\xe2\x80\x99s really helpful is that you can search for programs across your traditional TV service, online streaming services, and marketplaces offering titles for rent and purchase.
he BOLT devices also include other handy features, like the ability to skip through commercials, watch with sped up audio, watch live and recorded shows across web and mobile in and out of the home, and even access content from your computer via Plex.

\r\nIt turns out Tivo still wants to be in the retail hardware business. After years of pumping up its software platform, selling to service providers and taking on new customers and capabilities through its merger with Rovi, Tivo has once again cemented its status in the consumer hardware market with the launch of the Tivo Bolt Vox, 4K Tivo Mini Vox and Tivo Vox Remote. \r\n
"TiVo's Big Consumer News Isn't at CES"
\r\nThe voice control application lets users search and control video across live TV, digital recordings, the video-on-demand catalog and web-based streaming services. Like the 
\r\nThe Hydra interface adds personalization to the Tivo guide. In addition to weaving new metadata and artwork into the menu screens to make finding content easier, the new UI includes a QuickView feature for seeing what shows are currently playing on different tuners, Tivo-recommended content, favorite channels and a one-line channel guide.\r\n
\r\nInterestingly, the Vox remote is designed to work not only with existing Tivo Bolt boxes, but also TiVo Roamio and first-gen Tivo Mini set-tops. The accessory is priced at $40 for Bolt customers and $45 for Roamio and Mini owners with the addition of a separate Bluetooth adapter.\r\n
\r\nThe 4K Ultra HD Tivo Mini Vox will retail for $180. All of the new Tivo Vox products will officially go on sale starting October 29. \r\n

"\r\nTivo's financials have improved in recent months, with expected revenue rising slightly to an estimated $810 million to $830 million for the year. And the company has made headway in its patent lawsuit against cable giant Comcast. (See "
"\r\nHowever, the company's primary gains have come in the service provider space; so much so that Tivo doesn't even appear to break out retail revenues in its earnings reports anymore, a change that apparently occurred after the Tivo/Rovi merger. At the end of the "
, when Tivo still listed retail subscriptions, the company reported 974,000 total cumulative retail subscribers. That compared to 6.15 million Tivo customers in the pay-TV operator market. \r\n
"\r\nThere's also the undeniable fact that Tivo's consumer hardware products are far more expensive than media streaming boxes from companies like Amazon and Roku. On the one hand, the Tivo DVRs boast significantly greater functionality -- the ability to record video, for instance. On the other hand, it's still not clear if Tivo's appeal is enough to overcome both the initially-higher price point and the monthly service fee that the Tivo set-tops require. \r\n"
"\r\nFor now, it looks like Tivo is willing to continue investing in the retail hardware market despite an uphill battle. Perhaps it's worthwhile just to keep the iconic consumer brand name alive. The question is, will the company keep the retail hardware channel going in the future? Or will it eventually drop the business as executives have indicated in the past? (See "

"@Mitch It sounds like you've had a tough time cutting the cord. My experience with streaming content has been a bit different than yours. We only used DVR when we had\xc2\xa0satellite TV so DVR doesn't bother us...app design and development does."
"We use a Roku to watch and have issues with the UI of certain apps. Amazon has a different vision of app functionality than Netflix. The Amazon app is very bad at rewind and pause while the Netflix app is great. Hulu has a weird way of helping viewers choosing a new show. They shuffle every line of shows/movies after you click on something. It's madness trying to get back to where you were because that spot no longer exists.\xc2\xa0"
Imagine how well Tivo could do if it offered a better interface than all the other set top boxes!

Is the new Hydra software coming to the previous generation Bolt? Do we know when?
"We tried cutting the cord six months ago or so and have struggled with it since. I'm pretty much ready to throw in the towel. Two problems: (1) It's hard getting the HD signal for OTA TV just right and I miss a lot of shows. (2) I'm a former TiVo fanboy who stopped using TiVo for a few years when Cox gave us a cheap HD DRV. And now that we're back in the TiVo universe, well, I've been very disappointed with the latest TiVo UI. It's cluttered and what's worse is the controls work inconsistently inside apps. For example, rewinding inside the Netflix app is different from inside the Amazon app, for example. And even after six months, my thumb still mashes the TiVo button when I want to hit Select.\xc2\xa0"
"Next step for me will be calling Cox to get a TV card to put in the TiVo, which will solve problem #1. However, I'm told those are fussy to install so I'm not looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0"
"My advice to anybody cutting the cord is: Don't, unless saving money is of primary importance to you, and you enjoy the puttering to get everything just right (which some DIYers will do and that's fine).\xc2\xa0"

iVo Shows Off Predictive Hydra UI Again
may not have had much to show on the hardware side at CES, they did show off continuing work\xc2\xa0on a new user interface for their products that happens to be built with Android in mind, and with some predictive smarts in tow, called Hydra. Hydra was announced a while back, but TiVo has remained mostly silent on it until now. This interface is not based on Android per se, but instead will have an Android version that can run as an Android app. This opens up a world of possibilities beyond the boxes that TiVo manufactures itself, perhaps even into the full Android ecosystem. The smart features are the big draw of the interface, and are made to deliver personalized recommendations to users with a minimal interface that gets them the content that they want quickly.
Hydra\xe2\x80\x99s ability to run on Android does not just mean that it can run on a

he predictive smarts come courtesy of a firm that TiVo acquired back in 2014, known as DigitalSmiths. Their specialty is leveraging TV guide data, user data, and other data sets to help gauge and predict user behavior. In the new interface, users will see a number of suggestions based on their past behavior and recent picks to watch. According to\xc2\xa0DigitalSmiths, users tend to pick their recommendations about 60 percent of the time on weekdays, when they\xe2\x80\x99re strapped for time, and 40 percent of the time on weekends, when they normally have more time to be choosy or even look for something new. Hydra is reportedly in the final stages of testing and approval, and should be making its way to all TiVo customers as an optional update before the end of the year. Once a user has upgraded, however, they cannot go back. Right now, there is no word on a release date for the Android version.

ivo Bolt Vox DVR review: New look, same old app problem
s time goes by,\xc2\xa0 TiVo gets harder to love.\xc2\xa0The cable-box DVRs for which TiVo serves as an alternative are becoming more sophisticated, with modern interfaces, voice search, and built-in streaming apps. Forgoing cable entirely is also getting easier, thanks to a proliferation of streaming services and new over-the-air DVR solutions. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s consumer hardware business is getting squeezed from both directions.
he TiVo Bolt Vox is an attempt to push back. Like the existing TiVo Bolt, the Vox serves as either a DVR for cable subscribers or a way to record free over-the-air channels from an antenna. Its main addition is a new remote with voice search, and it also ships with a long-awaited software overhaul. (Existing TiVo Bolt and Roamio owners can upgrade to the new software for free, and buy the voice remote for $45.)
But while TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s recording capabilities are still second-to-none, and its integration with streaming services is still a clever idea, the Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s additions only paper over deficiencies in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app platform and hardware. Despite the new software and voice search, using a TiVo Bolt Vox still feels like stepping back into a bygone era.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has the same design as the old Bolt, with a rectangular enclosure that arches updward on one side. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a coaxial input, HDMI output, optical audio output, 3.5mm audio jack, e-SATA storage port, and two USB ports. (The USB ports don\xe2\x80\x99t support external DVR storage, and the only e-SATA drive that works with TiVo sells at a huge markup.) A hatch underneath the Bolt Vox houses a CableCARD slot.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has every conceivable port you might need.
iVo is selling three versions of the Bolt Vox. The 500GB model and 1TB models both have four tuners and cost $200 and $300 respectively. The 3TB model has 6 tuners for $500, but it only works with cable, not over-the-air broadcasts.
In all cases, TiVo charges $15 per month or $150 per year for DVR service. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lifetime service option for $550, which is on top of the cost of hardware.
If you want to use TiVo as a whole-home DVR, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Mini or Mini Vox satellite units, which costs $150 and $180 respectively. The latter comes with the same voice remote as the Bolt Vox, and it supports 4K video. The Tivo Bolt Vox can stream live and recorded TV to iOS and Android devices at no extra charge. (There\xe2\x80\x99s also a beta app for Fire TV devices, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been updated in two years and only works with recorded programs.)
One thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice with the TiVo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x94at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting out in the open\xe2\x80\x94is that it\xe2\x80\x99s constantly whirring. Noise emanates from the unit whether it\xe2\x80\x99s recording or not, whether the TV is on or off, and strangely even when the TiVo itself is on standby. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a major nuisance, especially from 10 feet away, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of how unobtrusive fanless streaming boxes and sticks are by comparison.
One might say the same of the TiVo Bolt Vox remote, which remains a hefty tool loaded with buttons, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99ll seldom press. The main differences from the regular Bolt remote are the new voice search button (more on that later), a Netflix button, and a dedicated button for TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s existing ad-skipping feature. Cable subscribers will likely feel at home with the setup; but again, those who\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to streaming players like Roku and Apple TV may recoil at the remote\xe2\x80\x99s chunkiness.
he Tivo Bolt Vox remote borrows more from cable boxes than modern streaming devices.
he Tivo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s biggest new feature is its software, previously codenamed \xe2\x80\x9cHydra\xe2\x80\x9d and now just known as the New User Interface. It\xe2\x80\x99s pre-loaded on the Bolt Vox, but existing TiVo owners have the option to upgrade as well.
iVo has given its UI some much-needed streamlining.
he new software strikes a more modern look, trading rounded rectangles and color gradients for sharp edges and solid colors. It\xe2\x80\x99s also more visual, often letting you scroll through thumbnail images instead of plain text.
More importantly, it provides a much-needed streamlining to the menu system. The main menu now has three content sections\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Shows\xe2\x80\x9d for recordings, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d for recommendations, and a launcher for third-party apps\xe2\x80\x94plus a search function and a settings menu. The What to Watch menu is especially useful, creating a unified TV guide out of various channels and streaming services. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a strip of quick recommendations at the bottom of the screen, based on what TiVo thinks you might like.
he \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d menu pulls upcoming programs, recordings, and streaming video into one handy guide.
Voice commands are helpful too, letting you jump around the menu system and search for titles, actors, and directors. The remote seldom failed to understand me, and search supports complex queries like \xe2\x80\x9c80\xe2\x80\x99s comedies\xe2\x80\x9d and follow-up questions like \xe2\x80\x9cJust the ones with Rick Moranis.\xe2\x80\x9d You can even filter the results to only show content from Netflix, Amazon, or Vudu. The only downsides are that search doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with all streaming services\xe2\x80\x94HBO Go is a major omission\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t search from inside a third-party app.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search is accurate, and understands complex queries.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s software still has some rough patches. Transitions and animations tend to be choppy compared to modern streaming boxes, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon menu concept\xe2\x80\x94in which rows of image thumbnails appear as you scroll through a column of menu text\xe2\x80\x94can be disorienting compared to fully image-driven apps like Netflix. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no apparent way to browse shows by genre while filtering out results from streaming services. And most annoyingly of all, TiVo always reverts to playing live TV when it\xe2\x80\x99s left alone in a menu for too long. It really ought to revert to standby mode instead.
Beyond those gripes, I imagine some TiVo enthusiasts will be dissatisfied with design changes in general, and with some particular things like the replacement of the 
It\xe2\x80\x99s all the more tragic, then, that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s streaming app support is still lacking.
lthough TiVo offers most of the basic streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any streaming channel bundles, which cord-cutters might want to supplement over-the-air channels. The platform has MLB T V, but not NBA League Pass or NHL TV. CBS News lacks the live anchored coverage that\xe2\x80\x99s offered on other platforms, and neat new streaming apps like Pluto TV and Hoopla are also absent. Aside from HBO Go, pretty much every TV Everywhere app is missing from TiVO as well. A fresh coat of paint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app catalog is stagnant.
You know an app platform has problems when Flixfling and Ameba are near the top of the list.
he TiVo Bolt Vot is still a great DVR at its core. It allows users to get granular with their recording preferences, for instance by keeping only a certain number of recent episodes, avoiding recordings in standard definition, and customizing start and stop buffer times. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to weed out scheduling conflicts through a dedicated menu, and with four tuners in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s base models, conflicts should be rare to begin with. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s OnePass feature, which lets you view recorded and streaming episodes of a show from a single view, remains a nice touch as well.
But without a vibrant app scene, the TiVo Bolt Vox still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as an all-in-one entertainment box for the streaming age. Cord-cutters in search of consolidation should instead look to 
a decent option for a single television
, provided you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind switching inputs when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stream.
he TiVo Bolt Vox will mainly appeal to diehard cable subscribers who might not mind the investment in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s hardware and services. But as more people give up cable TV in favor of antenna channels and streaming services, the squeeze on TiVo seems unlikely to let up.

iVo has overhauled the user interface of its Virgin Media TV platform for the first time in around four years.
s well as extensive visual enhancements, the update introduces improved recommendations and content discovery services.
he menu structures have been redesigned to aid navigation, while the classic red background has made way for a plum colour scheme with refined fonts.
he Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) retains its grid layout, but now lets users move backwards through the listings and watch shows that have already aired on-demand.
"TiVo has placed emphasis on content discovery and will now recommend shows based on the user's viewing habits, and even automatically download them in the background."
 predictive search function has also been introduced, and downloaded content will be arranged into categories, such as Kids, Movies, and TV & Radio.
Under-the-hood refinements will ensure that TiVo runs quicker and offers higher-resolution imagery, and the flash-based apps it currently uses are being phased out in favour of HTML5-powered services.
More apps will also be available to TiVo customers thanks to an agreement between Virgin and Opera, which is integrating its app store into the platform.
he update will begin its rollout next month, and is expected to reach all customers by the end of the year.
Virgin Media has also updated its TV Anywhere mobile service to bring it in line with the new TiVo.

iVo Shows Off Predictive Hydra UI Again
may not have had much to show on the hardware side at CES, they did show off continuing work\xc2\xa0on a new user interface for their products that happens to be built with Android in mind, and with some predictive smarts in tow, called Hydra. Hydra was announced a while back, but TiVo has remained mostly silent on it until now. This interface is not based on Android per se, but instead will have an Android version that can run as an Android app. This opens up a world of possibilities beyond the boxes that TiVo manufactures itself, perhaps even into the full Android ecosystem. The smart features are the big draw of the interface, and are made to deliver personalized recommendations to users with a minimal interface that gets them the content that they want quickly.
Hydra\xe2\x80\x99s ability to run on Android does not just mean that it can run on a

he predictive smarts come courtesy of a firm that TiVo acquired back in 2014, known as DigitalSmiths. Their specialty is leveraging TV guide data, user data, and other data sets to help gauge and predict user behavior. In the new interface, users will see a number of suggestions based on their past behavior and recent picks to watch. According to\xc2\xa0DigitalSmiths, users tend to pick their recommendations about 60 percent of the time on weekdays, when they\xe2\x80\x99re strapped for time, and 40 percent of the time on weekends, when they normally have more time to be choosy or even look for something new. Hydra is reportedly in the final stages of testing and approval, and should be making its way to all TiVo customers as an optional update before the end of the year. Once a user has upgraded, however, they cannot go back. Right now, there is no word on a release date for the Android version.

ew TiVo Bolt taking forever on Getting Setup Info
Can I use Tivo to stream without a subscription?
iVo Roamio OTA compatible with cable? Thanks!
"Can't sign into Amazon Prime on TiVo Bolt"
I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of purchasing TiVo Roamio OTA 1 TB and wondering if there is really no monthly payment. It just seems to good to be true.
ivo Fire TV Stick App Not Working
Upgrade your TiVo UI - Request form
Is there a button to keep the interface we have now?  Forever?
"Supposedly they are not going to force an update to Hydra.  Don't know if this is forever, I expect not.  "
"Probably not.  Got forced into the 'bolt' style interface on my Roamio and it is WAY TOO WHITE.  Who at Tivo thought THAT was a good idea?  Oh yeah, the moron that designed the Hydra interface."
Just updated.  I don\'t like it.  It\'s hard to navigate, information density is terrible, and your eye never naturally goes to any associated text.  For example, replacing the useful grid or list on "what to watch" and "My shows" with strips makes it basically worthless.  Strips SUCK!!!! BLECH.
I can really do without all of the superfluous animations as well.
Why do redesigns suck?  Sonos just pissed off a lot of their users with a shitty redesign, sounds like TiVo is right behind them!
"Designers" who obviously don\'t think about actually using the thing.  But "oooh animations and transitions!"
hank you for putting designers in quotes..  Those are definitely not actual designers, who take user feedback and testing into consideration.
"Yeah.  WebOS/Duarte are designers.  The guys who did OS/2's workplace shell are as well.  "
I have just tried it. Wtf is with the ultra tiny guide. I know my eyes are tired and old but come on. I am now super happy to be trying out a tablo with the new Roku stick. 
I hear ya but I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go on record that I love the guide where you can scan a lot of shows. If you have ever used xfinity box, it\xe2\x80\x99s horrific to see 3 channels at once.
I know but there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a happy medium. 
.  Although full disclosure, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never checked the settings for this!
I gave up on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s backing up now and tomorrow I\xe2\x80\x99m going to roll it back. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided if this has been the step to far. I will probably start migrating away from tivo. 
here is no way hydra is optional forever. I am looking to migrate away slowly. 
Just need Plex DVR to run on a raspi for each room, and put a tuner on the Plex server.  Not an option yet, unfortunately.
I have plex, and i love it but the dvr still isnt great. i cant wait till it is great. 
"You could configure the old interface to give you a grid too.  It doesn't seem there is any option at all with the new guide. "
"I believe there's one in the 'A' options in Guide."
"style" over function.  Of course I want it to be pretty, but not at the expense of fluid usability.  It is nice to put bookmarks on the home screen, and the new up arrow and down arrow things on live tv are interesting, but frankly not very useful beyond a prettier info popup.
I agree. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t it just go to My Shows when you hit the tivo button. 
ny reviews of the new interface before I take the plunge
I am worried about slow down big time! 
Well now there is Movantic, ask your doctor. 
I would let others do it first. There has got to be a reason it is considered optional. 
I upgraded my Roamio. Speed actually seems same or a little improved. Obviously the upgrade was about more media content (you know, cover shots for each show / movie), however, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel functionality suffered at all. Pleasantly surprised with a bunch of little improvements. 
Overall I\xe2\x80\x99m giving the upgrade a B. Nothing life changing, but tweaks seem good! Looking forward to my Vox remote coming later this week because I think Voice could turn the B to a B+ or A.
Ugh we are using older remotes without back buttons.  The description sounds like they are going to ruin our TiVo experience 
I believe with the old controllers your screwed. 
urns out the zoom button is the back button on Old remotes
o, the Zoom button became the Exit button.
We may be talking about two different remotes...  Is your zoom button on the left side or right side of the remote?
My Zoom button is on the left side of my TiVo Mini (first-gen) remote.  When I use it on my Bolt (which has the Hydra UI), it acts as an Exit button (pressing it while in My Shows takes me back to Live TV instead of to the Home screen).
"My Mini isn't running the Hydra UI, so I suppose it's possible that the button is interpreted differently on the Bolt than on a Mini, but that would seem odd."
"Is this documented anywhere?  I've been looking for it but can't find it."
o looks like my upgrade was processed because when I did a force connect it sat downloading for a while. After the download finishes I just need to reboot my box to get it to install?
ice - nothing changing on mine yet - 60 mins into the request... tried restarting my box early on but staying away from that in case of downloading (which I can\xe2\x80\x99t see). 
Force Connect. I waited for hours unitl I tried a force connect and then it worked.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTivo has just released the new Tivo Vox line of equipment.  Basically just makes all the Bolt equipment come in black, dropping the white versions.  But they did introduce a new 4K Mini client.
\nThey also released their new UI, code named Hydra.  It appears to be a complete rewrite of their existing software.  Overall it is getting good reviews, but as with any new software, there are some complaints and missing things.  The software works on the Roamio and Bolt lines, as well as the new Vox line.
\nWith this, there is a new remote available which brings voice control/search to Tivo for the first time. Tivo also indicated that Echo support is coming sometime in the future.
"\nThe upgrade to Hydra has to be requested by the user, probably because if you get it and don't like it,  downgrading to the previous software wipes all recording and one-pass info.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they will make new SW for DTV DVR's ?\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"I'm thinking you have the updated version, how do you like it?"
\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOverall I like it a lot. Much more graphical in nature than the previous version.  As usual when making a sea change in the look and feel, it is taking a bit of time to get used to the differences.  A few things are missing but a Tivo rep has said they are working on it and updates should be coming along fairly soon.
\n1.  Lost the live guide, only a grid guide is there.  Live guide is very handy when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something on a particular channel, like a new show, and aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure when it is coming.
\n2. Channel sorting is only by channel number, no option to sort by channel name.
\nUpgrading to the software went smoothly on the Bolt and Roamio, but the minis fought it a bit.  Usually just a power pull restart would get things going on the gen 2 Minis.  Gen 1 minis fought harder from what I read, not sure that got fixed yet.
\nWith the new Vox hardware is a new remote that incorporates voice, the new remote is available separately and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got mine ordered.

"\n Hehe... Same comment I was about to make. I've used X1 for a while and currently use TiVO's new Hydra UI. Wife and I definitely prefer X1.\n "
"\nI've not used the Hydra but had been on DirecTV's DVR platform for 20 years (using TiVo and their own version of DVR) and was recently forced to Comcast when I moved. I can't understand how anyone would prefer the X1. Voice is cool but other than that I hate this thing. The guide and whole UI is poorly designed in comparison. I have a whole laundry list of things I could do on DirecTV that I can't do now and things that are just plain annoying."
\r\nBut to each his own I guess.\n

\n                    The main thing that makes me reluctant to drop money on an all-in service plan is streaming cable options are getting better and better.\n

\n                    For me the only downside of Tivo is the potential for a problem to pop up.  I just know that Verizon will blame my Tivo equipment, no matter what the cause may be.  
"\nLast problem I had, with receiving certain channels, they blamed my house's wiring.  So I left it, and when my service died one day, the tech came out and said there were all sorts of bad equipment in the outdoor box.  Surprise, my channel reception problem was now fixed."
\nAnyone know if the extended warranty for the Refurb Mini means 2 years total?  Or 1+2 years?  If it is two years total, I get that with my credit card.\n

\n 1) will the Mini also be able to see the Bolt?
\r\nYes. You can pick which DVR to join and you can switch. The available DVRs (any TiVo on the same network) will show at the bottom of the recording list. 
"\r\n2) Will the Roamio Pro and the Bolt be able to see each other's recordings?"
"\r\nYes, but not all in one menu. You can see the recordings from the box you are controlling by pressing the TiVo button. At the bottom of the menu are the other available TiVos. If you select one, it will take you to that box's recordings list. "
"\r\n3) if the mini can't see the bolt, can you transfer recordings between the bolt and Roamio Pro?"
\r\nNot applicable as they can see each other. Menus function the same. You can delete recordings, etc.  there is no way to transfer between TiVos- at least that I am aware. 
\r\nI have a TiVo Bolt, Roamio, and Mini on my network. They just work.\n 
\nThanks for the update.  I looking forward to getting it hooked up.\n

\n Which 4TB WD drive did you buy?\n 
\nThere is a very reputable seller on fleabay named "central_valley_computer_parts_inc" (with underscores) that sells good WD drives that you cannot buy in stores.  I bought a "70 Hours" drive from him for $163 shipped.  I know hard drives well and tested it thoroughly with my linux server (put 48 hours on it testing).  The drive also only had 55 hours on it when I got it.  They sell drives that have zero hours, 50 hours, 70 hours, 300 hours... just pick your price point and buy one.  They were having a sale when I bought the 70 hour drive and it was the cheapest of all their 4TB drives at a time.  They also have 3TB and 5TB drives.
"\nBe aware that with the BOLT if you go larger than 3TB you can't just put it directly into the BOLT.  You have to prep the drive in a Windows PC first, but it is very easy.  All the info is on tivocommunity forum."
\nAfter I posted on tivocommunity about buying the drive several others also posted back that they had also bought drives from the same seller with perfect results.  They have a 30 day money back guaranty also.

\n                    Go ahead and throw your money away on devices that wont do ATSC 3.0 or the future Cable CO IP delivery when they dump cable card technology.
\nLong term investment in Tivo is a waste of money. It would be a good investment if they press release their intent in supporting new technologies.\n

\n                    Anyone have experience with upgrading the hard drive? Was thinking of getting the Tivo 500gb w vox remote and then manually upgrading the hard drive to a seagate 4tb hard drive but am concerned for the warranty issue.. Not sure to just do 
\r\nI have a Roamio for 9.99 per month I use for streaming (really just use the comcast x1 for cable), ideally would like a 6 tuner for as cheap as possible, looks like Id have to wait till tomorrow to see if the 3tb Bolt Plus will go on sale. Think a rep accidentally slipped in telling me that a renewed 3tb/plus will be $324.99 for tomorrow but not sure. Still cheaper to manually upgrade the hard drive but its only 4 tuners with the 500gb one... gah... dont know what to get.\n

\nWarranty. 90 days vs. 1 year. Plus the new one comes with the VOX remote which should future proof you a little when Hydra drops.\n

\nIt says the warranty is the same for refurb or new.  At the bottom of the white out sale page.
\n"5. A "TiVo-renewed" device is a factory refurbished device that is fully tested and certified by TiVo and includes TiVo\'s standard manufacturer\'s warranty for that device."

\n                    I also use my Tivo Bolt and did not have any issues with my FIOS subscription or premium channels. I did need to warranty out my first Bolt though due to a tuner issue. The new one (refurbished) does not have any issues <knock on wood>.\n

nything You Can Do (with Betty Hutton) lyrics
\n        TiVo To Go and advanced Remote Control\n    
\n        Brought to you by:\n        \n        \n            \n                
\n    Use watchedTime for TimeOffset if bookmarkPosition not available\n  
\n    Just the -a. The -b is only 1 run through anyway so not relevant to that option.\n  
\n    So when running from the command line it will work with both the -a and -b options?\n  
\n    Option works for both GUI and batch modes.\n  
\n    I\'m running kmttg in batch mode using a cron job in Ubuntu. If I enable the "GLOBAL SETTING: Do not wait for all jobs to finish before processing new ones", does that play well when running in batch mode? Or is this intened only for \'auto\' mode? I can switch over to auto mode and remove my cron job, but since my server is not very accessible, most of my management is done via SSH. I can remote desktop into the server to open the kmttg GUI anytime I want to make a configuration change, but that\'s...\n  
"\n    Here's an update. If I login to the Tivo via a web browser I can transfer over the entire .Tivo file. (ts format works, haven't tried mpg) Again when trying to download via kmttg, in windows or Mac, ts or mpg the full file won't come over. And, again, this has begun to happen in the past couple of weeks. Can only see last 50 or so recordings in browser, any idea how to list or page through the older recordings?\n  "
\n    File begins to download like normal, then about 10 percent or so of the way to completion it quits, moves to decrypt and subsequently checked steps. Occasionally the ts toggle on/off will remedy.\n  
"\n    Have been having the same problem in recent weeks, OSX and Windows. TS does the trick most but not all of the time. Didn't have this problem til about 2 weeks ago. Now intermittent but more frequent.\n  "
"\n    Apologies if I've missed the feature or a thread already discussing it... But is there any way (ideally through the auto transfer interface) to sync the local files to the tivo? It would be an easy way to manage my local disk space without having to do anything. Thanks - Joe\n  "
\n    Got it, running it, perfect. Thanks again.

\n    On TiVo in Diagnostics menu where it shows tuner information for channels you can tell. Or if you have a downloaded .TiVo file you can use "mediainfo" to tell. Note that if you are on Windows platform you can use DirectShow Dump to decrypt instead (you need partial TiVo Desktop installed at least for that), and it has no problems decrypting any TS file. VideoRedo also can decrypt if you have that (again WIndows only).\n  
\n    That was it; thanks! Is there a way (other than guessing based upon file size) whether a video on the TiVo is mpeg2 or mpeg4?\n  
\n    So that\'s the problem. Sounds like it\'s not decrypting correctly. TS files can be problematic to decrypt. By size of the file sounds like it\'s mpeg2, so if you turn off "Download TiVo files in TS format" my guess is decrypt will work properly and then you should be able to play .mpg file and encode it etc.\n  
"\n    Nope, the .ts file doesn't play. VLC shows just a blank picture with audio.\n  "
\n    Make sure the decrypted .ts files play in VLC VideoLAN or like player before anything else.\n  
\n    Some episodes have started to have trouble encoding the video portion of the file. The files are stored on a Roamio Pro (NOT updated to Hydra). I\'m using the "Download TiVO files in Transport Stream format" and "Decrypt using tivolibre instead of tivodecode" options. There doesn\'t seem to be much rhyme or reason to which episodes encode properly. With the show I\'m currently having trouble with, one day\'s episode encodes fine, then the next day\'s episode might not. Out of 25 or so episodes I tried...\n  
\n    Kevin, thanks for the fast reply! I feel kind of foolish being that I\'m in IT Support, but the TiVo reboot worked! (my first line to most users is "have you rebooted yet?") I assumed (incorrectly), that it was on the kmttg end. I just downloaded a full episode from the Roamio Plus without issue. Thanks again! Chip\n  
"\n    That's an issue on TiVo side. You can verifiy by attempting to download same shows from TiVo with a web browser. Things you can try to fix it: 1. reboot TiVo 2. Download as PS container instead of TS container (turn off config--Program Options--Download TiVo files in transport stream container in kmttg). Note that H.264 recordings REQUIRE TS downloads however, so if your provider is Comcast or another with many H.264 channels that won't work.\n  "
"\n    Removed hack for refreshing table data - replaced with method that doesn't throw exception for Java 9\n  "
"\n    OK thanks! Seems to work OK with non Hydra UI still, so I've commited the change along with another change to print total show time which gives another quick indication if it looks about right.\n  "
\n    User-contributed tweak to work with Hydra plus print total show time information\n  
"\n    Here's the patch I've been running with, and it seems to work OK so far... but I wouldn't be surprised if I/we don't find other glitches due to changes in the way the interface/remote interact under hydra.\n  "
\n    I\'d done that same thing in my testing before and it didn\'t work - I needed to add another sleep in this bit of code: json.put("event", "play"); r.Command("keyEventSend", json); Thread.sleep(sleep_time); // added line } // while I\'ll add an attachment with my patch later, which seems to be working pretty well so far.\n  
\n    The kmttg.jar in this zip file has sleep time changed from 900 to 1800ms between presses. See if it helps at all: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0SMFC97ymdEaWJQVTE1aTY2amc\n  
"\n    Yeah, it looks like it's a timing thing... I noticed that for pretty much any show, kmttg wasn't jumping to the end, but if I added an extra 'Thread.sleep(sleep_time);' after the Jump command, then the navigation at least got that far, and sometimes would back up one skip point... but then the timing between keypresses seemed to fall part still and wouldn't got the whole way. Guess I'll need to play around with the timing some more.\n  "
\n    It\'s already there. There\'s a "channel filter" option that can be used for each setup. https://sourceforge.net/p/kmttg/wiki/auto_transfers/\n  
\n    Hello everyone, This tool looks great but I was trying to see if there is a way to transfer all shows from the TIVO based on the Channel or Call Sign? Thanks for your assistance. Cheers, Norman.\n  
\n    Oh yes, the THX video download never worked (though it appears to allow it).\n  
\n    I tried a different program from the TiVo, and it worked. I guess that THX Optimizer Video is not downloadable or something.\n  
\n    In VideoRedo start with opening a .TiVo file then setup and run a batch (background) job within VRD. That uses the same mechanism as kmttg to call VRD, so should trigger to fix whatever is needed to make it work.\n

\n    I cant really help much as I don\'t plan to update to Hydra any time soon if ever. If you haven\'t already you need to look at autoskip from skipmode visually. So, make sure the TV is on attached to the TiVo and then select a show in NPL table and use the "v" to start autoskip from skipmode on it. The sequence kmttg uses is jump to the end of the program and then skips backwards using channel down to find the show start points. Repeat this several times for 1 show that\'s not working to see if any of...\n  
"\n    I know I should've waited, but I saw people saying that kmttg worked fine for them (guess they just download shows but don't actually use autoskip functionality)... so I got the new interface on my Raomio yesterday, and this morning noticed that a show I had downloaded and had the commercials chopped out was only 6 minutes (of an hour) long. So I ran auto-skip from skipmode on a couple shows and in that case it only found one short section, and other shows kmttg actually failed to find skipmode data....\n  "
\n    Check for 1. for Java 8\n  
\n    Add search for image since recent TiVo changes dropped image from responses\n  
"\n    Don't invoke Reflection method for Java 9\n  "

\n    Run readSettings in runlater and dump stack trace to log window\n  
\n    For benefit of Java 9 added some column size weighting code\n  
"\n    I've seen sometimes (for some shows) where AutoSkip from SkipMode can take 2 or 3 tries to actually find the show start points properly. If you find that is happening often usually a reboot of the TiVo will make it more responsive and less likely to have trouble. To debug, one thing to do is bring up AutoSkip Table: File--AutoSkip Table, then you can click on relevant show entries and it will print all the show points to the message window. That's quickest way to judge if the skip points look right....\n  "
"\n    I've read the release notes on how Autoskip does tries to figure out where the cut points are, and that it should sometimes have a 3-4 second issue, but I've been consistently having problems where several minutes of commercials are not getting cut out, and that same several minutes are getting cut from the actual show. What could be the issue here? I can post logs if necessary, just need to know what is necessary to post.\n  "
"\n    There's no kmttg code in the stacktrace at all, so whatever the issue is must be specific to Java 9 itself. I'd say it's way too early to jump on Java 9 and best to stick with 8 until the bugs are ironed out of 9.\n  "

Upgrade issues we are tracking (from TiVo)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\nI wanted to update you on the top issues we are tracking with the release of our new BOLT VOX and MINI VOX products, as well as the VOX Remote and updates to our 4th generation user experience (aka Hydra). Right now, we are prioritizing issues that cause lack of functionality. I will edit this post as new issues are discovered and/or fixed.
We believe we have fixed this issue
- It appears that in the latest release of gen3 UI (20.7.4) we have broken compatibility with Slide remotes on 1st gen MINI devices. Additionally, it appears that Slide Pro remotes may not properly work with MINI VOX running any release. We are testing this further to identify the root cause.
We believe we have fixed this now
. If you are missing some apps, or are getting V301 errors, please force 2 connections to the service and restart your MINI to see if all of the apps reappear. The biggest gap we have is with the Amazon Video app. We are finalizing 4K certification with Amazon on MINI VOX.
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks Ted. I wish there was a longer list. But I have been using the TiVo support forum. My issues
\nNo RS Corrected counted on a basic Roamio or Bolt.
\nDo your best. Thanks for being here. I wish I was out there with you. I lived in San Mateo for 15 years. Paradise. But way too expensive.
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks again for your following all of the issues on here, its a lot to keep up with.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks as well, Ted. There are also a few more issues being reported here
\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYes, I upgraded on Sunday with a Roamio Pro and a 1st Gen Mini.  The only way I can get the Mini to work was by adding its TSN to the update page and then it updated.  However, I am getting the V66 error.  Usually, unplugging the Mini and letting it boot back up fixes it for the duration of viewing.\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUmmm.  The amazon 4K app on the Bolt has been 4K not 2K for a few weeks now\n\t\t\t\t\t
... I am getting the V66 error.  Usually, unplugging the Mini and letting it boot back up fixes it for the duration of viewing.
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat about the 30 second skip issues. In the old ui 30 second skip would just stop working when you caught up to live tv. Now it goes backwards a bit and the sound drops out. I need to press fast forward or 8 second rewind to get sound back. This happens every single time I 30 second skip to live tv. Even if I only press it once. I\xe2\x80\x99ve already lost sound 10 times watching the World Series game tonight. 
\nHere are a few things, of concern to me and others, that, IMHO, have been omitted from your top issues being tracked list.  It would be educational to see how they are prioritized, or if they are even being considered.
\n1.  Turn on the ability to revert to Gen3 (version 20.7.4.RC2).
\n2.  Ability to revert to Gen3 (version 20.7.4.RC2) without loss of recordings.
\n3.  Restore ability for pyTiVo and pyTivo Desktop to transfer compatible recordings from a computer to TiVo.
\nItems 2 and 3 are the reasons I have not tried Gen4 (Hydra).\n\t\t\t\t\t
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWill we see an option to transfer recordings other than using Tivo online?\n\t\t\t\t\t
- V66 connection errors - Periodically, MINI and MINI VOX devices are losing connection to their host DVR and reporting this error. The error also unfortunately states that it might be a CableCARD problem, when in fact it has nothing to do with CC as far as we know. We are looking at log files and investigating this problem. It does appear to be fairly widespread, despite the fact that it did not appear during our beta testing.
"\n- Apps on MINI VOX - We are working to increase the number of apps on MINI VOX. Because of the new architecture, we don't have full coverage yet. The biggest gap we have is with the Amazon Video app. We are finalizing 4K certification with Amazon on MINI VOX. Once we have that, we'll release it to existing devices and then move on to certifying it on BOLT. The current Amazon app for BOLT is 2k."
"I've been experiencing these V66 errors pretty consistently, but also some periodic audio skipping problems on the mini as well. Any chance the audio is hydra-related as well?"
"\nI'm missing Plex and the Xfinity OnDemand app on my Mini Vox as well. Are these unsupported like Amazon?"
"\nI was able to add plex to my tivo central shortcuts but it doesn't work.\n\t\t\t\t\t"
\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPlease keep the 30sec skip issue on the radar.
\n - Audio fully drops when 30sec skip reaches the front of the buffer, requires pause/play or skip-back to recover - (i.e., to get off the front the buffer)
\n - Audio drops for ~3 seconds after each click of 30sec skip\n\t\t\t\t\t
. Please let me know if you are still seeing this problem.
oes this fix include the "Black Screen Downgrade Loop" when connecting a Mini Vox to a bolt on Gen3 UI? I got through this, but it was hours of frustration.\n\t\t\t\t\t

Can I use Tivo to stream without a subscription?
iVo Roamio OTA compatible with cable? Thanks!
"Can't sign into Amazon Prime on TiVo Bolt"
I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of purchasing TiVo Roamio OTA 1 TB and wondering if there is really no monthly payment. It just seems to good to be true.
ivo Fire TV Stick App Not Working
iVo Hydra - Not a fan so far
"I upgraded my 1TB Tivo Roamio OTA and Tivo Mini to Hydra a few weeks ago hoping the new interface would make them feel more modern.  While it does feel more modern to some extent, I don't think it's worth all the quirks, bugs, and poor design decisions."
"I've been keeping track of my complaints, none of which were an issue on the previous version.  Here is what I have so far, which I "
he back button being required instead of being able to use the left button is annoying.  Suggestion: allow both the back button and left button to have the same function when appropriate.
he guide up/down buttons changing the entire page instead of going to the next channel is annoying.  That\xe2\x80\x99s what the channel up/down button is for.  Why was this changed?
he My Shows gigantic bar with pictures takes up too much space.  Add an option to turn it off.
he smaller text is harder to see in the Guide, My Shows, etc.
he guide shows the wrong listing for a single channel of mine. Guide lists the programming of the channel I cannot get, yet viewing channel shows content of the channel in my area.
My Shows are sorted by episode instead of recorded date by default. I prefer sorting by recorded date and have to change it every time.  Please allow changing the default sorting method.
My Tivo Roamio intermittently stops outputting sound on antenna.  This was not a problem on the previous version.  Restarting or switching to an app and then back resolves.
My Tivo Mini intermittently loses connection to Roamio. Restarting Mini resolves.
everting to the previous version requires wiping all content and schedules.  This is not a good user experience.  The operating system should be stored separately from the content.
o you guys agree or disagree?  Am I being too picky?  What do you guys think of Hydra?
Wholeheartedly agree. It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone at TiVo who had never before used a TiVo\xe2\x80\x94and had only had the experience described to them in vague terms\xe2\x80\x94was tasked with designing the Hydra UI. It just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo\xe2\x80\x9d to me. Things are unnecessarily complicated, and some of the changes feel completely arbitrary. For example, it seems like the threshold for prompting the deletion of a show once you\xe2\x80\x99re towards the end has been changed. Whereas before I could head back to the menu right as the credits started to roll and get that prompt, now it seems hit or miss. I also hate the new \xe2\x80\x9cFavorite Channels\xe2\x80\x9d stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s been assigned to the left arrow button on the remote. It\xe2\x80\x99s counterintuitive and users should at least have the option of restoring the legacy functionality.
his is the stuff devs should be interested in hearing.
1000TimesThis
here are some good ideas and feature in it but some basic things (like what you mentioned plus a few more) are really disappointing. TiVo has been known for their amazing user experience and seems like it went out the door too fast. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping they change it because as is this could be the start of the end for TiVo and that would be such a shame. I hope they realize how serious this is. If the interface isn\xe2\x80\x99t amazing then just use the cable providers box and save money. 
"Yep, it's the interface and multiple integrations that brought me to TiVo. If it goes to shit I'll probably just switch to using my TV since it has native support for the popular streaming apps along with OTA antenna. I'd just be missing the DVR functionality, which can be supplimented."
I upgraded a spare Roamio and will not be touching my Bolt or Roamio Pro. 
You\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a great write up and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel like a beta tester. This is clearly a whole new system not an upgrade, otherwise some core things like left to go back or live guide would still be applicable. 
Without an easy way to downgrade, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hold tight until some of the kinks are smoothed out. This feels like the whole guide data fiasco. 
common tasks should be quick and fluid.  They are not.  3 clicks to play or delete after the horrid navigation through a crappy sliding UI is ridiculous.
the UI should be consistent and predictable.  It is not.  It is all over the friggin place.  Get huge thumbnails moving down through recordings, but after moving back to the top it is now text only again.
the UI should be configurable.  Why can\'t the "show all" grid be my preferred default behavior?  Why must I use the sliding bullshit that looks like something better suited for a phone swipe interface (but it would suck ass there too.)
there is no clear indication of where you are or what you are doing in the UI at any time.  What an incoherent mess!
"I'd much prefer actual ingenuity over what looks like a script kiddie high school webui project.  Oooh!  Lookit our graphics and effects!  That animation is rad!"
"Instead of worthless side menu for tuners, how about  a full screen grid of what's on all tuners, and a way to highlight each to change their channels?   How about some flexible pip stuff in general?  I have four friggin tuners.  Let me interact with them to my advantage "
"Instead we get the worthless side menus that don't convey things nearly as well as a simple select on live TV used to."
verything about this is half-baked and a far worse "experience".  I don\'t want an experience.  I want a clean ui that gets it done and gets out of the way.  I\'m not here to play with your ui.  I\'m here to navigate my media.  TiVo has forgotten that with this garbage.
"I agree about the back button (#1). That is incredibly frustrating. Of the rest of the things, I don't think it's an issue for me. Honestly never noticed/don't have that issue for #2-#5. #6 sounds like an annoying bug. I do agree that if you have a preferred sort method (#7) then you should be able to retain that preferred method. #8-#9 also sound like bugs, as I'm sure you had no issue before with connectivity or sound. #10 just flat out sucks - first off I didn't know there would be a way to revert, but doing so wipes out content? Stupid."
he biggest complaint from my house is that they took away the "PLAY ALL" feature for folders. This stops us from being able to marathon shows, forcing us to interact with the device at the end of every episode. Not too much of an issue for me or my wife when we are watching our shows, but a huge hassle for our small kids who just want to watch 10 episodes of Paw Patrol uninterrupted on a rainy weekend.
hydra is junk to me. i rolled back my units and planning my exit strategy because i cant imagine this getting better. maybe a bug fix here and there but this is the direction. no thanks. 
o glad this is not forced upgrade.  I hope it never is.  The current UI is perfect.  
"Tivo, please don't force us to update.  (I have a Roamio OTA)"
. The show preview panes are nicer, the show listings are cleaner with respect to seasons.
he one feature that Hydra grabbed me with was the 
. We always struggled to see what was playing on the TV behind that thing in the past, now I can see right through it. Seriously, it is just stunning that it took that long to get transparent controls.
My wife loves the new favorite channels interface. I like the customization of apps you can do in the menus, we use Plex and Netflix quite a bit, this way of opening those apps is much cleaner than before. I also like that it seems to be watching me to determine 
I miss being able to hit TiVo-2 for to-do list, TiVo-4 for search. Those mnemonics just made 
. If I can customize TiVo-5 thru 9, why change the established numbers for 0-4 and make them inflexible?
We\'re hitting the "minis can\'t connect" garbage, not as frequently as previously, they say that\'s "fixed", who knows where that is in the rollout tho.
My main wish for this new interface is that they\'ll explore skinning. Customizing the colors and views should be easy given the modularity they seem to be building into things. I also hope they revisit some of the design choices. Looking at "My Shows" feels odd, the scrolling is weird and most of the screen is blank even with the preview panes of episodes.
"I'm looking forward to bugfixes and feature enhancements."
For your #9, a soft/network restart is faster than restarting the mini.
hould result in a chime and an arrow to the right. Once completed, live TV should work again without a complete restart.
I already downgraded, but this is great for future reference!

One can only hope that all these guide data update interruptions are an indication that work is being done on the infrastructure for the guide data.

"I've had my Bolt since dang near the original launch."
"1) The guide (and yeah, I know the main problem) but I will take time and fill out getting the channel lineups fixed five at a time.  I wait a week...and they fix around 3/5 of the issues.  (Wrong logos, just the wrong channel, I can tune to a channel but it says no data available in the guide, etc.)  I'm not even addressing the point they have program listings wrong, even though that is quite often.  Then the kicker is, within another week I get a message that undoes one of the fixes.  Baffling."
2) VoD stopped working with Comcast around a month ago.  Basically will show the logo of the channel that it is coming from for about 3 seconds and then never play the thing.  Have no idea where to go from here for that issue since it was working.

iVo Mavrik\xe2\x80\x99s FCC confidentiality has lifted\xe2\x80\xa6 suggesting the unannounced cord cutting solution is behind schedule but treating us to even more pre-release photos and intel on the product (\xc2\xbb
). It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear at this point that Mavrik is a Tablo-esque network tuner that streams live over-the-air television and DVR recordings to set-tops, like Fire TV, and mobile devices. While we know Mavrik will offer a cloud DVR service, a la Boxee, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear if the two-tuner, headless set-top will also record locally via included SD slot or USB-attached storage.
More FCC analysis from the TiVo Community indicate the Mavrik incorporates Bolt-level processing and transcoding capabilities, an 8GB cache, and 512MB of memory. Beyond Tablo, also active in this space is Channels which utilizes HDHomeRun hardware to pipe live (or recorded) television into Apple TV and iPhone or iPad.

etails are quite vague, but it looks like it may be RF-only?
"If so, that would be a no-go around here.  I've had to disable the RF comms on the current remote, opting to go IR-only."
I dropped the remote one too many times.  With the RF enabled, the remote does not need to point towards the TiVo, and a dropped remote often hits the large channel-change buttons, changing the channel and kill the 30 minute buffer I was watching from.

2017-Jul-24
2017-Jul-25
"It took a while, but I've learned which buttons to press and which not to press."
Having said that, I still kill the 30-minute buffer with that unfortunate button-press via a dropped remote.
"But the pressing of an incorrect button is quite different than dropping the remote and having the remote's contact with the floor press a random button that usually seems to result in the 30-minute buffer being negated.  "

"Having used the full size premium glo remote sold during the Premiere era, and the short remotes currently on the market now, I still prefer the premium glo with it's full size and hard buttons. If TiVo ever bothers to put RF functionality in the premium glo sized remote, that'd be pretty awesome and popular, especially for users who prefer larger remotes."

"TiVo's Big Consumer News Isn't at CES"
By Mari Silbey, Light Reading - January 6, 2017
"But what about product innovations beyond voice control? In the service provider space, TiVo has readily moved away from hardware in order to port its software experience to a wide range of video devices manufactured by others. Already, TiVo has its user interface on set-top boxes from Arris, Technicolor, Evolution Digital and more. As [TiVo SVP and GM Michael ] Hawkey notes, it's reasonable to presume that TiVo will soon take a similar approach in retail."
"We used to build the boxes with operators," says Hawkey. "We\'ve transitioned that off to Technicolor, to Arris, to Evolution. That\'s a logical progression that at some point in time maybe I could do the same thing in the consumer [environment]."
"The hints from Hawkey echo what TiVo executives have already said publicly. The company is very committed to retail, but not to selling its own hardware in the future. And that means that 2017 is likely the year that TiVo starts selling TiVo-branded products at retail that brandish the TiVo UI and connect to TiVo's cloud, but are also not made by TiVo as a manufacturer."
One more tidbit. TiVo already has a 4K DVR on the market. Coming soon, expect to see a corresponding 4K TiVo Mini client box. So sources say.

FYI - It looks like the TiVo Mini 4K is a go
By Dave Zatz, Zatz Not Funny! - August 7, 2017
While TiVo may be dialing back marketing expenditures in the retail segment, the back half of 2017 is looking pretty promising for us consumers.
nd, speaking of that new TiVo hardware\xe2\x80\xa6 I can confirm that, while the Mavrik initiative has been scrapped, the TiVo Mini 4K is a go. Dropping the original trapezoidal TiVo Mini form factor, the updated extender is more Roku Ultra in appearance and subtly carries forward the TiVo Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s design arc. While the headline feature may be 4K and the small number of services that have chosen to provide the higher video resolution to TiVo owners, I anticipate at least Bolt-class processing power \xe2\x80\x94 meaning it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a much more snappy and usable app platform than the legacy TiVo hardware provides and something I would absolutely upgrade for to access Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video on Input 1 vs. flipping to Roku or Fire TV. I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting both TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice remote and the 4K Mini to hit this fall, along with at least one compelling new software trick\xe2\x80\xa6

"TiVo Refreshes Retail Lineup With Voice-Powered 'Vox' Devices"
Company unveils Bolt Vox, Mini Vox, Vox Remote
By Jeff Baumgartner, Multichannel News - October 24, 2017
iVo is beefing up its retail product line with new versions of the 4K-capable Bolt DVR and Mini client device that support voice-based search and navigation and carry the company\xe2\x80\x99s new \xe2\x80\x9cVox\xe2\x80\x9d branding.
he new Bolt Vox and Mini Vox work in tandem with TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s first voice-powered remote control, called the Vox Remote.
he updated video platform, the first major retail refresh since TiVo and Rovi completed their merger last September, enables voice search across live TV, recorded DVR content, VOD titles and integrated OTT services such as Netflix and Hulu. It also supports a new interface that that bakes in personalized recommendations (what TiVo calls a \xe2\x80\x9cSmartBar\xe2\x80\x9d) and \xe2\x80\x9cintelligent predictions\xe2\x80\x9d based on prior viewing behavior. Also new is QuickView, an element that lets viewers see shows playing on different tuners built into the DVR, and a one-line channel guide.
In addition to enabling conversational-style voice searching (i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me movies with Tom Cruise"), the new voice component is also tied to other TiVo features such as SkipMode and OnePass (i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cCreate a OnePass for Modern Family).
he baseline TiVo Bolt Vox bakes in four tuners and 500 GB of storage, works with digital cable systems or programming that is delivered over-the-air, and starts at $199.99.
 beefier version of the Bolt Vox, only for use with digital cable systems, comes with 1 terabyte of storage and six tuners.
he TiVo Mini Vox, which works in tandem with the Bolt Vox and is tailored for whole-home set-ups, fetches $179.99.
otably, existing TiVo Bolt, TiVo Roamio and first-gen TiVo Mini customers can upgrade to voice control by purchasing a separate TiVo Vox Remote. The Vox Remote for BOLT (in black or white) sells for $39.99, while the Vox Remote for Roamio products (OTA, Pro and Plus) and the first-generation TiVo Mini is available only in black, includes a separate Bluetooth adapter, and is priced at $44.99.
iVo said its new suite of Vox-powered products will become available on October 29 at TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s web site, Amazon.com, and at Best Buy stores nationwide.

"TiVo has good news going into the holiday season: The International Trade Commission (ITC) has ruled that Comcast's X1 set-top boxes violate two of "
". An import ban would mean that offending gadgets that've already been brought into the country can't be sold. This ban could be overturned by the Trump administration during the presidential review period. "
s more people cut the cord or switch to on-demand options for watching their favorite shows, TiVo is becoming less relevant. It gets a good deal of its money from patents and 
, and as such is keen to defend what it can to stay in business. Hence the patent infringement lawsuit with Comcast.
"Naturally, Comcast has a chance to appeal and the telco has said that it plans to do so. Additionally, Comcast is going to fight the ruling in the US Patent and Trademark office, where these types of battles are easier to win. The ITC ruled that a quartet of other patents regarding how recording works in homes with multiple TVs and Comcast set-top boxes didn't infringe on TiVo's claims. The USPTO process can take up to a year to settle."

 TiVo is updating its Bolt DVR lineup with a new remote, 
Ok, so maybe it\'s not that much of a secret, but this does represent most noticeable revamp of TiVo\'s UI since the first boxes appeared, with a renewed focus on predictions and personalization. The TiVo boxes have offered universal search for years, but the company claims that its new software is smart enough that if you ask for "Tom Cruise movies" followed by "the one where he says "show me the money" it will pick out the right one. 
"It doesn't stop there either, as existing features like commercial skipping and setting up recordings are also voice enabled. The new hardware means all of the boxes (including the Mini) are ready for 4K, and it can even show a preview of what videos are playing on each tuner. Of course, if you're sticking with an older TiVo there will be software upgrades, and you can add on the new voice remote. It costs $40 to bring it to the original Bolt DVR, while Roamio/Mini owners are charged $45 for the remote and an accompanying Bluetooth adapter."
he main TiVo Bolt Vox will come in a couple of flavors. The quad-tuner edition is ready for cable TV or cord-cutter friendly antenna viewing, with either 500GB or 1TB of storage inside and a price that starts at $200 before you add on the required service package. A 3TB version ready for 450 hours of recording via six built-in cable tuners will also be available, along the new TiVo Mini Vox extender that costs $180. All of them are set to go on sale October 29th, either through Tivo.com, Amazon or at Best Buy stores (even if some people have scored one already)

I know you use TIVO for OTA. My wife has dictated that we must have AT&T Sportsnet Rocky Mountain which will force me to Xfinity/Comcast. 
\nThe questions I have (maybe the manual will answer) is how I configure or customize the guide. From what I can tell local channels are mapped in three different places on Comcast.
"\nSD Channels are lower numbers. HD are in the 600's and also in the 1000's. We will mostly watch HD."
\nThe inlaws X1 box automatically switches to the HD channel if you chose a SD channel. An example: The guide shows SD channels on their OTA channel number, but when you choose channel 4 it switches you to 654, the HD channel. I have no idea why but it is also listed on 1004. 
\nJust not sure how this works with TIVO and Comcast channels all over the place in their lineup. I guess that is where the VOX or suggestions will find shows, but being old school I would like to see a guide arranged the way I want it. I suppose there is a way to customize the guide to my liking?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t
10-30-2017\xc2\xa0
"I'll tell you what I find funny, here people are constantly complaining about why doesn't DirecTV use a smaller guide font and put more data in.  TiVo does just that with Hydra  (10 channels/2 hours) and over at TCF there are a ton of complaints that the guide is too small.  You will never please everyone."
\nHere is a pic of the guide, I have no issues with the size.  It was taken to report a bug in the display of guide data (which has been fixed) so no comment there 
Heaven forbid that all these DVRs have an option for two different sized guis in regards to text.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t

\nIt will take some getting used to. Spent a lot of this morning creating a favorite channel list. Comcast/Xfinity has channels all over the place in the guide. Finding it is easier to just use the voice remote to tune to channels.
"\nWas able to get live TV and recordings to play on my wife's iMac which I could never do with DirecTV. Everything plays fine on the IPhone also. Looks like I can do away with my Slingbox!"
"\nNow to figure the best way to get programming on other TV's. I held out on getting a Mini Vox for now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"There's an Amazon Firestick TiVo app, if you have one of those."
From what I can tell the Firestick will only let you watch recordings, nothing live? I understand that Roku works with Comcast, but may not let me see recordings on the TIVO, only live TV.
"\nStill not sure what direction I will go yet. Maybe a Mini but don't like the cost. I wish the Mini was wireless. I don't have cable or internet in one room.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t"

"If it's like the iOS app, if you select a live  program, it starts recording for you then allows you to watch the recording.  At the end it'll give you the keep or delete function.  Its not ideal but does allow you to at least watch something. I use the app often when sitting out on the swing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t"

11-03-2017\xc2\xa0
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am liking it myself.   Live guide is not an issue as I didnt like it before, the tiles in the playlist go away if you have your options set correctly and the whole whole back button issue seemed silly.  The overall apperance is much better.  I did have a couple minor issues but they have corrected themselves\r\n\t\t\t\t\t

"I have personally developed a new alternative to TiVo Desktop that's derived from pyTivo but does not require you to install python on your machine and has a completely custom UI developed by me. The installer includes the TiVo DiresctShow filter that VideoReDo needs to decrypt .tivo files so this can also act as a replacement for TiVo Desktop for editing your .tivo files in VideoReDo. Best of all it's free! :)"
"\r\nIf you'd rather continue to use TiVo Desktop it's still available in an archived section of TiVo's website, but they have abandoned it so it could potentially disappear at any time..."
Can this run as a Windows Service?
"No. I tried to get the pyTivo service to compile the same way the main version does, but it didn't work correctly. I spent a whole day trying to get it to work and couldn't but it never worked right. It wouldn't annouce the shares correctly. "
\nIf you really need it to run as a service you can run it the old way (install python on your PC) using my version of pyTivo...
"\nand the UI app will still work. You'll have to create a link to it directly though and not use the tray app because the tray app will cause a conflict."
\nThanks for creating this. I installed it without any obvious problems. However, when I run it, it finds my Tivo but then appears to hand on "Loading show list..." Do you have any idea what\'s causing this or how I can fix it?
\nThanks for creating this. I installed it without any obvious problems. However, when I run it, it finds my Tivo but then appears to hand on "Loading show list..." Do you have any idea what\'s causing this or how I can fix it?
"\nHow long did you wait? It's downloading XML data from your TiVo 50 shows at a time (max TiVo allows) and then compiling that into a list. On my PC using Bolt and Roamios it's relatively fast (few seconds), but when I try to load my Wife's old S2 unit it's really slow (45+ seconds). Unless there is some sort of error it should eventually load."
\nI waited over an hour and pyTivo Desktop just hangs on loading shows. However, if I go to localhost:9032 in a browser, it finds and loads the shows in under 2 seconds.
"Hmm... that's weird. Do me a favor. Go to the tray icon and stop pyTivo. Go to the install folder and double click pytivo.exe. Now launch the Desktop UI and look at the pytivo console window. Does it print any errors? "
\nWhen I said a long time I meant 30-45 seconds. If it takes any longer then that then something is wrong.
Go to the tray icon and stop pyTivo. Go to the install folder and double click pytivo.exe. Now launch the Desktop UI and look at the pytivo console window. Does it print any errors?
\nWhen I double click on pytivo.exe, the Console window displays
\nINFO:pyTivo:Last modified: Sun Apr 16 20:44:28 2017
\nThen when I launch the pyTivo Desktop, the Desktop app finds FR Tivo and gets to "Loading show list..." after which nothing further happens and the Console window doesn\'t change from what it displayed immediately upon launch.
he console window should continuously update with http requests from the desktop app. 
\nExit out of the tray app completely. Then open the task manager. Do you see pyTivo.exe still running? If so kill it. (there will be two copies, this is normal, kill them both) Also if you have the old pyTivo service running you need to stop that as well as it will cause a conflict. After that relaunch the tray app and start desktop, does it work now?

\nI did have a VB net. adpt. running. I disabled it, but that did not fix my problem. I tried all the setting changes. That did not help. I rebooted the router, pc and the tivos and that did not fix the problem either.
Hmmm..... try this. Exit out of pyTivo completely. Open the task manager and kill any remaining pyTivo processes. Now go to the install folder and launch pyTivo.exe manually. That will show a command window. In that window you will see a line that says "Searching for TiVos....." and it will either print the names of the found TiVos after that line or after 30 seconds it will timeout and move on. Does it ever find the TiVos?
"\nIf it doesn't then it could be the firewall. Try temporarily disabling the firewall and then run pyTivo.exe again. Does it find any TiVos now? If so you'll need to add an exception to the firewall to allow pyTivo.exe access to the network. "
"\nIf that still doesn't work then I'm stumped. Do you have any other network adapters? If so try disabling them.

If there was some way for me to duplicate the issue here I might be able to trace it, but it works fine for me and only a couple of users have reported issues like this."
Hmmm..... try this. Exit out of pyTivo completely. Open the task manager and kill any remaining pyTivo processes. Now go to the install folder and launch pyTivo.exe manually. That will show a command window. In that window you will see a line that says "Searching for TiVos....." and it will either print the names of the found TiVos after that line or after 30 seconds it will timeout and move on. Does it ever find the TiVos?
"\nIf it doesn't then it could be the firewall. Try temporarily disabling the firewall and then run pyTivo.exe again. Does it find any TiVos now? If so you'll need to add an exception to the firewall to allow pyTivo.exe access to the network. "
"\nIf that still doesn't work then I'm stumped. Do you have any other network adapters? If so try disabling them.

If there was some way for me to duplicate the issue here I might be able to trace it, but it works fine for me and only a couple of users have reported issues like this."
\nI think I found the problem. When I shut down Tivo Desktop and everything related to it, pyTivo Desktop found all of my tivos and loaded all of the shows in a few seconds.
"Super sweet!  I'll be giving this a try.  Thanks for creating this!  Will get back to you with feedback as soon as I can try it."
"It hangs for me getting the show list on my roamio that's got quite a bit of content on it.  Has no problem with my elite that only has a couple shows.  Anything you need from me?  Thanks!"
"It hangs for me getting the show list on my roamio that's got quite a bit of content on it.  Has no problem with my elite that only has a couple shows.  Anything you need from me?  Thanks!"
\nIt hangs forever? It can take a little bit of time depending on your network. The pyTivo server part caches the data so it only has to reload it when something changes. (there is a last updated date in the data I check)

"\nNetwork is a gigabit lan.  I left it overnight and it never came back.  So yes, hung forever.  I've tried killing it and starting it again with the same result."
omething must be crashing then. Do me a favor. Stop pyTivo using the tray icon menu. Go to the folder where you installed pyTivo and double click pyTivo.exe. That will launch pyTivo in a visible command window. Now go into the desktop sub folder and double click pyTivoDesktop.exe. Watch the command window as it tries to load your list of recordings. Does it print any errors? If so can you copy/paste them here so I can see what they are.

"That's bizarre. I'll double check the code and look for errors, but I'm not sure what would cause that. I'll also throw some extra logging in for the next version so maybe we can see what's going on."
"Looks like we're good on that one.  Thanks!!"
hank you for the time and effort that went into this, Tivo Desktop had started throwing out of memory errors.
nyone here interested in testing out a new version of pyTivo desktop that includes VideoReDo integration?
"\nThis version allows you to post-process downloaded .tivo files using VideoReDo. It has 3 options.... AdScan, QSF and Profile. The Profile one allows you to select any profile in VideoReDo to save a file to after it's downloaded. This could be used for recoding for a mobile device, or just converting to H.264 to save some space."
\nEdit: This feature is now standard so just download the latest build.
"Oh HELL yea that's awesome.  I'll definitely try it out next time I have a recording.  Not many summer shows this year lol.  Love the idea though!"
"I'm not sure how the post-processing is supposed to work.  Any tips?"
"It's in the settings, download tab. There is a whole section to setup VideoReDo Post Processing."
"I see it now. That's quite well hidden.  LOL!  I'll check it out later today.  Thanks!"
If you have any suggestions on a better place to put them let me know. I was going to add another tab just for VideoReDo, but it caused the tabs to kick to two lines which looks weird.
"It's a good question.  I'll give it some thought.  I'll provide feedback later tonight or tomorrow sometime.  I love this idea, though, because I often have to convert from mpeg2 to h.264 for Plex and having it done automagically is sweet."
"Ok, I just discovered this as I was about to install TIVO Desktop.  Loaded ver 1.6.16 to my Playon server.  It sees all three of my Tivos and I'm able to download from all of them.  I'm confused about going the other way though.  Should my Tivos see the directory specified for the downloads automatically or do I have to do some other thing to enable that?  My server is running Win 8.1."
"It doesn't currently do that automatically. It offers to create a share in the installer, but it's not dynamically linked so if you change the directory either is pointing to the other isn't updated automatically. "
\nShares you use to pull video from your PC to your TiVo are managed on the Shares tab. They appear at the very bottom of My Shows with the All filter selected or in the Devices list.
"All right, the directory I'm using is the one specified in the Shares tab.  Each of my three Tivos, at the bottom of My Shows, see the other two Tivos.  If I turn on the PC running the ancient Tivo Desktop, that PC will also show up as a device.  The pyTivo PC doesn't show up.  Any thing I can look at?  Reinstall differently?"
"That's usually a firewall problem. Did Windows prompt you to allow pyTivo through the firewall the first time you launched it? You need to answer yes to that, or manually add it to the firewall. "
"\nI've also seen some complaints about it conflicting with virtual network adapters installed by VM software or VPNs. If you have any of those try disabling them. One last thing you can try is go into the settings, select the network tab, and set the zeroconf option to off. That will force it to use the old TiVo Beacon protocol which can sometimes work when zeroconf doesn't."
"It WAS the firewall.  I enabled all the pyTivo exe's and it worked fine.  I then removed them to try adding them one at a time, but Windows THEN decided to ask if I wanted to enable pyTivo in the firewall.  I said yes and it continues to work as needed.  A great tool.  Thank you for your quick replys.  I been using VideoReDo since 2010 to process Tivo recordings and it's been great fun."
FYI VideoReDo integration is now standard, so just download the latest build.
"Here's a fun little piece of functionality to try adding if you're bored one day.  :D  The Bolt and Roamio TiVo's have skip mode cuts that get downloaded after a show is finished recording on some channels.  It'd be very handy to be able to export those into a VPRJ for the downloaded TiVo file so that you don't really have to commercial scan them."
"No really possible. Kmttg offers this feature but it uses a TiVo or Mini to play the program then sends the D button command and records the location. PyTivo doesn't have the code needed to control a TiVo like that."
"I was actually considering adding it, but with the new Hydra interface on TiVo they're removing the ability to transfer shows from PC to TiVo. TiVo to PC still works, but who knows for how much longer. Not sure I want to put much more effort into someing TiVo seems to be phasing out."
"I hadn't read that about Hydra.  I was kind of looking forward to Hydra.  I upgraded my Elite to a Bolt a month or so ago and love it.  I still rely heavily on the ability to pull stuff off the TiVo, edit with VRD, and drop onto my Plex server.  If they remove the TiVo->PC transfer then the TiVo becomes MUCH less useful to me.  At that point I could drop cable and just move to all streaming."
"Yeah I'm hoping they don't do that either."
"The good news is I've upgraded both to Hydra and can still pull shows.  And there's discussion in the TiVo forum that the PC upload to TiVo functionality may simply not be complete yet.  However, given that they've really stopped working with the developer community, I'm not super hopeful that things will get better.  I'm hoping they at least stay as they are."

I was reading that a cloud based DVR service is now in Beta, how is that going, and what kind of time frame do they expect it to go live?
I was reading that a cloud based DVR service is now in Beta, how is that going, and what kind of time frame do they expect it to go live?
"I've heard mention of cloud based DVR services in the past, but never quite understood the concept."
urely they don\'t dedicate storage to each user to record things "in the cloud" and then stream them. There would be a ton of duplicated data.
How does this differ from something like Hulu, where I can subscribe to a show and it appears in a list when there are new recordings?
Is it some sort of hybrid between live streaming and video on demand?
Well I assume the Sling service is like the streaming guide service I currently have with Cox.\xc2\xa0 You can stream to a computer from the guide just as if your watching TV live from a cable box. This of coarse,\xc2\xa0 includes commercials, which is why I have a DVR.\xc2\xa0
"If they don't provide some type of box then they would have to be storing the content you record on their end.\xc2\xa0"
I gave the Playstation Vue a try as recommended on this thread. \xc2\xa0I have previously tried to cut the cable but found that I could not get some of the sports I wanted without cable (soccer and formula 1). However the Playstation Vue basic package for $39 seems to have the channels I need. So I tried the 7 day free trial. The problem I found is that it has a complicated online "DVR" and "on demand" way of viewing things in a confusing interface, that I found difficult to use. I currently have a Tivo Bolt which is pretty easy to use and my wife still gets confused. \xc2\xa0She would not work it out on the PS4 Vue. Shame as I would switch to it if they improve the interface. Might still consider it just for the sport, and then record what I can from the over the air broadcasts, so my wife can use watch those on the Tivo along with Netflix and other streaming content. But there will be some shows that we will only be able to watch on Vue.\xc2\xa0
"\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I like the solutions that people are coming up with in this thread, but unless it is something simple that is watchable on a TV (rather than a computer), my wife will not use it. \xc2\xa0I have to admit the modern Tivos with the one stop shop one passes for recorded, on demand and streamed shows is really nice, so it's hard to let that go. Also as other people have mentioned when you go to cancel they usually point out that if you cancel, (when you are getting the internet from them as well), the internet price goes up. So you may as well stay on basic for very little $s."
"I did eventually switch to the playstation Vue. Once I have got the hang of the interface it's not as bad I thought, but not as intuitive as my Tivo. I get a lot of channels for the $39 package including the sports that I was after. One thing I have noticed on sports is that the image quality is not as good as when I was watching on cable with my Tivo. It appears to be HD but the movement is not as smooth, so it looks a bit jerky or blurry when the camera is zoomed out on a soccer game. It's more like watching something HD on youtube, where it's not quite as smooth as TV. \xc2\xa0Form looking at some Vue forums some people reckon that is to do the with the frame rate, not being as high on certain channels. Regular TV shows look close to the same as it had with cable"
\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The nice thing with the VUE pricing is that it is $39 including all fees and taxes. With Comcast they quote a price but they add tax and whole bunch of other fees that inflates the price.
"If they don't provide some type of box then they would have to be storing the content you record on their end.\xc2\xa0"
I don\'t think that has to be the case. I would bet they are recording/archiving ALL the content, regardless of which users have requested to "record it". I doubt there is any need for them to store another copy of each program requested by each user. I\'m thinking they would have some sort of slick system that merges their VOD offering with their streaming service. I can totally see how all this could be fused together to look and act like your typical DVR, but share copies of deduplicated content between users.
For instance, Designated Survivor comes on tonight at 10PM. As the show is being broadcasted, they are simultaneously recording and streaming it... if you choose to rewind, you are basically being slung into a recording that was already being made on their end. If you select record, you don\'t actually initiate a recording, it was going to be recorded on the back end regardless... basically they would be buffering every program on the back end in its entirety, but the "recording" appears in your list as though you are recording it, with some sort of record icon to signify that you can only watch the portion of the program that has aired so far... at 11PM, once the program is over, that program in your list is then linked to an archived VOD version of that program, it is swapped seamlessly and you don\'t even know that the recording you were watching was dumped and you are now watching VOD.
One side benefit to this would be that I could turn on my TV, tune to a "channel" and then rewind a program that is already in progress, even though I was not previously recording it. I wouldn\'t have the limitation of only being able to buffer a few channels depending on the number of tuners which existed in my DVR.
Of course, I have never used any sort of "cloud based" DVR, so this is purely hypothetical and simply the way I imagine it would work.
"I don't think that has to be the case."
"The method you describe does make sense but it doesn't negate what I said.\xc2\xa0 If you are not storing the show locally on a device at your end then they have to be.\xc2\xa0 Methods of minimizing storage not withstanding."
"The method you describe does make sense but it doesn't negate what I said.\xc2\xa0 If you are not storing the show locally on a device at your end then they have to be.\xc2\xa0 Methods of minimizing storage not withstanding."
rue, I think I was focused too much on the fact that you used the words "content YOU RECORD", and I was simply trying to express the fact that YOU really aren\'t recording anything... they are doing the recording already anyways, and you are simply subscribing to that recording when you press the record button. Of course all this is hidden from the end users and presented in a way that appears familiar to them (you record shows, they are available to watch as they are recording or to watch later), even though this is not technically what is happening.
But yes, I believe we were basically trying to say the same thing.
Whatever the case, I would think this is eventually where DVR technology is going... unless the entire DVR concept is killed by content providers delivering new content by dumping it on VOD services at scheduled times instead of traditional broadcasting.

"\n\tI'm still pretty happy with my Tivo Roamio with an antenna."
\n\tWe have the "all in" plan on the Tivo, so it was a one-time fee for the life of the box and there is no monthly fee associated with it.
\n\tMine is not the OTA version... so I have the option of going back to a cable card if we ever decide we want to. However, the Tivo Roamio OTA with lifetime service included is actually a pretty good deal for someone who is trying to get away from cable.
\n\tI use a Mohu Air 60 antenna on my roof with the Tivo, so we get free local stations for news, weather, sports, and recording the bulk of the shows we watch.
"\n\tThen I pay $10/month for netflix and $12/mo for Hulu (Commercial-free option), and we access those over the tivo. I also have access to amazon prime, but we do that just for the shipping and very rarely utilize their streaming service. So $22/month with a moderate initial investment and I can access almost anything we care about. The only issue is ESPN. We have ONE NFL team we follow (Carolina)... other than that we don't watch much sports. Sometimes we just get together with a friend and watch when a game airs on ESPN.\n"
\n\tOne thing I thought would be a game-changer was Tivo\'s "one-pass" which aggregates local recordings and streaming options so you don\'t have to search through multiple services. Unfortunately, in its current form it is basically worthless. Sometimes newly available episodes on Hulu take days or weeks before they appear in the tivo\'s data... we usually just end up going to the hulu or netflix app to find things because the most recent episodes do not appear in our one-passes in a timely manner. It looks like there is a UI update coming sometime this year, and it appears they might be making some changes to the way this works, so I\'m hoping it works better in the future.
\n\tOK, thanks for the reply. I think I can probably do what you are with the equipment I have now.
\n\tMy TiVo can use cable or OTA from an antenna, and I have an antenna now that I use on the other TV
\n\tin the sunroom which I could easily split and feed to the TiVo. Already subscribe to Netflix and have Amazon
"\n\tPrime but I don't think I can\xc2\xa0stream that with the TiVo, might need a Roku or some other dongle device for"
"\n\tthat but I doubt we would use it much since we don't now except occasionally to something view on a PC.\n"
"\n\tIf I drop cable I still have to get internet through Comcast, it's the only game in town. No FiOS or anything else"
\n\tunless I wanted to go completely wireless. I dumped the landline phone 15 years ago and ported the house
\n\tnumber over to a cell phone for $9.99/m which saved $22 a month over the Verizon LL charges.\n
\n\tVerizon has all but abandoned POTS here, the cabling on the roadways is falling apart. There is one stretch
\n\ton a county road where you can drive for about a mile and between almost every pole see a tree laying on
"\n\tthe telephone truck line or TV cable. It's sad. If they don't have a need for those lines any longer why not take"
\n\tit all down and recycle all that copper? Probably costs more than its worth.\n
\n\tSo if I drop TV from Comcast my internet service cost will go up a bit and eat some of the savings.\xc2\xa0 So it seems
"\n\tlike I might as well stay where I'm at for now. I could improve my antenna and maybe pick up a few more channels,"
\n\tbut they would just be repeats of the 4 networks and\xc2\xa0PBS. We used to have 3 PBS stations, each running slightly
\n\tdifferent programming at times, along with some overlap of popular programs. But over the past 10 years they have
\n\tall been gobbled up by WHYY and offer pretty much the same programming all day long so no variety there.\n
"\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0but I don't think I can\xc2\xa0stream that with the TiVo, might need a Roku or some other dongle device for"
\n\tHow old is the Tivo? I thought anything that could accept a cable card (Series 3 / Tivo HD or newer) supported the streaming apps...\n
\n\tAlso, I use Hulu and Netflix a lot more after dropping cable. Especially Hulu... I had no reason for hulu until we dropped cable.
"\n\tFor a while I didn't even have an antenna. We watched everything over Hulu but missed having access to local news and sports.\n"
\n\t\t\tHow old is the Tivo? I thought anything that could accept a cable card (Series 3 / Tivo HD or newer) supported the streaming apps...\n\t\t

"\n\tweren't given a choice when the upgrade got pushed down and had no chance to stay with what we had"
"\n\tI feel screwed because what I paid for is no longer there. So I'll never buy another TiVo POC and I'll run"
\n\tthis one until the wheels fall off and in the mean time look for something else that fits our needs.\n
"\n\tI've upgraded two times so I have two older TiVos sitting in the basement that are useless to me."
\n\tI wish someone offered a\xc2\xa0hack to remove the TiVo software and turn it into\xc2\xa0a generic DVR with access
\n\tto a channel guide, even it was only for OTA recording at least I could get some use out of one of them.\n
\n\tBuy a small computer (and your storage, dvd, usb, bluetooth problems are solved). Then add an OTA, a usb tv tuner and install media center software. I recommend jriver (www.jriver.com) and you\'ve pretty much built your own tv/dvr box with no recurring fees. Then add firetv (or appletv, roku w.e.) and you can stream netflix, hulu, etc. assuming you have an internet connection. I dropped dish quite a while back and am very happy. While Game of Thrones is airing I subscribe to HBO Now for $10 a month (no commitment, month to month) and then unsubscribe once GOT is over for the season. I subscribe to NBC Sports Gold for $30 a year to get alternate sports, and do the same thing with SlingTV for a month or two for ESPN when I\'m interested in the playoffs, etc.\xc2\xa0 I think the "cable companies" have finally gotten the message that the days of year-long contracts are over, and that\'s not necessarily a bad thing for them financially. Would HBO rather have 100% of my $15 a month for 3 months, or 0% of my $0 dollars for a year?\n
\n\tI wrote a blog post about my cord cutting experience if anyone is interested here: 
\n\tAs TiVo keeps coming up in this thread, I figured I should add my latest addition to the conversation.
\n\tLast night I added a TiVo mini to our system for our master bedroom. I have only played around with it for one night but I was really happy at how well it worked. It\'s basically just like adding a\xc2\xa0"media center extender" for someone who was on WMC, but has more features.
"\n\tI just activated it and plugged it in via ethernet... I had one hangup where it didn't want to recognize my tivo at first, but after I rebooted the tivo and tried again now everything works flawlessly."
\n\tIt gives me the exact same interface and access to our recorded programs in an additional room. Its very snappy and has the same streaming apps and features as our roamio.
"\n\tI was also surprised that tivo bakes in MoCA with their devices. As my home is wired with gigabit ethernet, this wasn't something I needed, but it would be a nice feature for those who only have coax throughout their home. I'm already considering adding mini's to our kids rooms, but that's an entirely different topic of discussion."
"\n\tBoth my Roamio AND mini came with lifetime subscriptions, so I have NO RECURRING fees to use the tivo. I feel like I can't stress this enough, because when people talk about the tivo, the monthly fee is always something that comes up. If you buy the current OTA model, there is NO MONTHLY FEE! I get the majority of my content OTA for free also. The only thing is you need\xc2\xa0internet to download the program guide and updates... but that seems like it goes without saying these days."
\n\tI DO choose to pay for Hulu and Netflix, but my bill for access to our regular OTA programming and TiVo service is $0.00. We could absolutely get by with that and be happy, but I have no problem paying the $22/month for an almost endless supply of commercial-free, on-demand content from Hulu and Netflix.
\n\tIf you are looking into cutting the cord, this is a really good option. $399 one time equipment purchase to get started (Tivo Roamio OTA) + the price of an antenna (cost will depend on where you live and how strong the OTA broadcasts are). Then you can add the same functionality to additional rooms by adding tivo minis for $150. At that point you are done and will never need to pay out another dime\xc2\xa0unless you opt to add streaming services.
"\n\tHonestly, I don't see how anyone could complain about the TiVo interface. In my opinion it is one of the easiest and most simple interfaces ever created."
\n\tI\'ve used a DirectTV DVR, a couple of cable company DVRs, a windows media center DVR, and the TiVo, (actually, this is my 5th TiVo)\xc2\xa0and I can say the only thing that was "as good" as the\xc2\xa0TiVo was the Windows Media Center setup. However, Windows Media Center is a dying animal at this point. I\'ve been really happy with my decision to switch back to TiVo.\n
"\n\tI'll add a little bit to Smitho's comments. I have Tivo as well and I also have 2 of the the Tivo mini's. \xc2\xa0Smitho is right, the performance of the mini's is surprisingly good. \xc2\xa0No noticeable lag, same interface, same functionality as the TIVO OTA unit. \xc2\xa0Also, the Tivo OTA unit has 4 tuners, so you can watch up to 4 separate programs simultaneously, or watch one program and record others simultaneously. \xc2\xa0The interface on the OTA is very good, very intuitive and if you have ever used a cable DVR you won't have any trouble using the Tivo OTA. \xc2\xa0I use a Mohu Sky 60 outdoor antenna, and the reception through it is fantastic.\n"
"\n\tThe only difference in my setup\xc2\xa0is that I am running my mini's wirelessly, which Tivo says not to do. \xc2\xa0I use a dual band Wifi router (TP Link N750) and put all of the video on the 5 Ghz band. \xc2\xa0I have NetGear dual band range extenders (N300)\xc2\xa0(they have a single Ethernet port) that I run to the Tivo mini's. \xc2\xa0I wasn't sure how it would work over the wireless connection, but I've been using it this way for over a year with no issues. \xc2\xa0I can't tell that they are not wired.\n"
"\n\tI run all of my other devices, phones, laptops, iPad's, etc., on the 2.4Ghz band.\n"
"\n\tSo, I have the Tivo OTA & 2 mini's. We also use Sling TV, Netflix, Hulu & Amazon. \xc2\xa0Sling TV is very nice if you are looking for other channels and live broadcasts. \xc2\xa0Through it I have ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, SEC Network, TMC(Walking Dead), HGTV, EPIX & others for $25/month. \xc2\xa0In all, I spend about $50/Month for my TV services, but best of all, no contracts and no price increases (at least so far). \xc2\xa0 Sling is available via ROKU, Apple TV, Chromecast, etc. \xc2\xa0Previously I was spending about $135/Mo. when I had Time Warner.\n"
"\n\tI'm in complete agreement with Smitho, if you are looking to cut the cable, Tivo and/or Tivo mini's is a great way to do it. \xc2\xa0Sling, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon can fill in any gaps that OTA doesn't have.\n"
\n\tSo you paid 135 for TV services only, or was that TV and internet access, or is your internet access from someone other than Time Warner?\n
"\n\tI'm paying about $152.37 for internet and cable TV plus $10 for Netflix. If I drop TV, my internet access will be about $80, so if I add in Netflix and Hulu and Sling (assuming the prices would be the same as yours), I would add ~$50 to that and be at $130, and only save about $30/month, and possibly lose some coverage compared to what I have now. It's this small savings that has kept me from dropping cable TV. OTA I get about a dozen channels that are of any value, the other 20 some are junk like shopping channels, some stuff broadcast in languages other than English so of no use to me, or I'm on the fringe and reception is poor.\n"
"\n\tI was paying $135 for Internet, TV & Phone, but I wasn't using the phone service. \xc2\xa0When I cancelled TV and Phone, they wanted to charge me $69/Month for Internet. \xc2\xa0I ended up keeping Internet and Basic TV for $49/Month, but I don't use their basic TV channels.\n"
\n\tI have a hard time accounting for the Internet, because I would keep it regardless. \xc2\xa0As part of the "bundle", Internet was about $29/Month. \xc2\xa0There were some extra charges for DVR, extra TV\'s, etc., so my bill for all three services was $135. \xc2\xa0\n
\n\tNow, including Internet at @$49, I am paying in total about $100/Month for Internet and TV(Sling, Netflix & Hulu). So, I guess I am saving about $35/month all in. \xc2\xa0\n
"\n\tBut we have adapted to OTA/Sling/Netflix & Hulu and I wouldn't go back to cable unless it became significantly cheaper and I felt like it was going to stay that way. \xc2\xa0It seems to me that the cable model is changing. \xc2\xa0People aren't as willing to pay $75-$100/Month for cable for a bunch of channels they don't want. \xc2\xa0They want more a la cart options, (i.e., cheaper) and cable companies basically bundle\xc2\xa0a bunch of channels together so that the better channels support the weaker channels and they can generate more revenue than with a la carte options.\n"
"\n\tI can stop Sling, Hulu or Netflix anytime I want with no penalties, so I do feel like I have more control over what I spend each month. \xc2\xa0The Tivo unit with DVR and mini's really makes it seem like we have cable...the interface is very similar and we can record a lot of the shows we like to watch. \xc2\xa0In short, I'm very happy where we are today.\n"
\n\tIf basic cable was $1/day and you could add additional channels for a\xc2\xa0dollar or two each per month they would have more subscribers than they knew what to do with and competition would have never got a foothold. But they were greedy (as I see it anyway) and milked the cow for all they could as fast as they could.\n
\n\tInstead of running up the hill they should have walked up the hill as the older bull said. You know how the rest of that story goes.\n

\n\t\t\tInstead of running up the hill they should have walked up the hill as the older bull said. You know how the rest of that story goes.\n\t\t
"\n\tThe savings really come in for those of us who don't really need all those CATV channels and can supplement with Hulu and netflix."
"\n\tIf you have to add sling tv, or vue, you start approaching the point of diminishing returns as you are trying to duplicate a lot of that CATV content a many of us real cable cutters just don't care about."
"\n\tTo me, sling TV and vue are not much different than\xc2\xa0a basic cable TV package. It has a lot of content I don't care about and it cost a little more than I care to spend. It sort of negates the entire premise of ditching the cable TV.\n"
\n\tThey have a new interface being released "soon".
\n\tIt is unknown what devices the new interface will be pushed to.
\n\tI will refrain from making any judgement until I have had a chance to use it myself.\n
"I was paying the monthly fee after buying my TiVo for $50 at bestbuy but called up and told the rep I want a lifetime service...  he then said oh you want to cancel if you don't get a discount on lifetime service?  I said yes and got it for only $200.  Love my TiVo. You can sign up on their site to get the new update first."

\n\t\t\tI was reading that a cloud based DVR service is now in Beta, how is that going, and what kind of time frame do they expect it to go live?\n\t\t
"\n\tLOL, sadly I just now saw this. \xc2\xa0I heard the other day they were going to start offering it to employees to test before releasing it to the public. \xc2\xa0I would say it should be soon, but I am kinda in the dark on that stuff. \xc2\xa0I work in IT as a Network Administrator at a service center\xc2\xa0so I don't see much of the TV side of sales. \xc2\xa0I will try and ask around to people that might know around here. \xc2\xa0If it isn't a NDA, then I will let you know.\n"

"Five arrests in 'fully loaded' Kodi streaming box raids"
256\xc2\xa0comments
"It won't make a dent on piracy, in fact the use of Kodi will likely now increase as any press is good press."
"Just like electricity, people will always take the path of least resistance. If I open Netflix to watch an episode of something, and they only have half of the series/season, I'm just going to use Kodi to watch it for free. Why would I order a DVD and wait for days? Or buy it and wait hours to download it? Or setup another subscription service for a monthly cost? Why do any of this when I can be watching it within seconds, cost doesn't even factor in, it's just so easy and convenient."
"If Kodi/Exodus was a fully legal, licensed platform whereby I could pay monthly/per-show (at an agreeable price), I'd pay - because it's so easy to use and it has almost everything."
"Until that day though, I've cancelled all streaming services (as they removed my favourite shows or only offer series/seasons I don't want) apart from Prime as I like the delivery times and cloud storage. I don't even have a TV aerial anymore as that broke, I just have 3 TVs, 3 Firesticks and a Chromecast, job done."
">Why do any of this when I can be watching it within seconds, cost doesn't even factor in, it's just so easy and convenient."
Because it is stealing. Some people still believe in paying for value.
"Prime has a boat-load of movies and tv shows available for free or pay to watch on demand. I think their prices are a little high for 24hr rental (3.99$), but still it is legal. It is better to not go to jail than to feed one's entertainment lust."
In theft you take something from someone else, and they are then deprived of what you took. I take your loaf of bread, you have one less loaf of bread.

o we need another word than "theft" - and that word certainly isn\'t "piracy" - people that violate copyright, rarely murder people or disrupt trade routes and critical infrastructure.
"I'm not saying we don't need some system of compensation if we want to continue to produce art - but just as a boycott is a very passive act of resistance, so is not paying for crippled (DRM) content. Unfortunately it doesn't seem that there's a need to prove that someone watching a copy for free would be more likely to pay for that copy than go outside and play a game of catch if the content wasn't available for copying."
]This semantic tangent has been derailing these conversations on forums across the internet for years. I think it\'s time to put it to bed. No one is confused about this usage of the word "stealing," nor is your specific definition the only valid one. We don\'t need another word, "stealing" is just fine.
"No.  This 'semantic tangent' has very real consequences.  The propaganda equating copyright infringement with robbery is bullshit,  but bullshit with a purpose:  getting the government to pick up the task of copyright enforcement, because it's too costly to make sense for the lobbying organizations to do it themselves."
"If we accepted your handwaving, people charged with actually robbing someone's home and people charged with downloading half a season of Glee would face the same sentencing standards.  That is obviously deranged."
o, no.  The debate must continue, until consensus is reached and the matter fixed in law.
"> If we accepted your handwaving, people charged with actually robbing someone's home and people charged with downloading half a season of Glee would face the same sentencing standards."
Can you expand on this? Seems like a non-sequitur.
You are equating making a copy with theft.
"While I'm happy for you that you feel comfortable deciding that this can be put to bed, clearly many people feel differently."
"I'd argue that merely the observation that many intelligent, morally sensitive people here on HN feel differently should be enough to realize that this is not a 'tangent' that can be 'put to bed'. Why would you even put it like that, knowing that there is such disagreement?"
Because it\'s a purely semantic argument (in the literal sense of being an argument about the definition of words). There is no fundamental universal truth underlying whether it\'s OK to refer to piracy informally as "stealing".
If you wanted to pay for it, what does it make it?
"The creator has not lost anything.  It is not zero sum.  They haven't lost money, they haven't lost time..."
his line of thinking can only be followed by selfish motivated reasoning.
uppose I bake 100 brownies and try to sell them one morning. I sell some and as I\'m packing up my booth you take one and eat it. You argue, "I was never going to pay for a brownie, I didn\'t want it that badly, and anyway you can\'t sell them tomorrow because they will be stale."
"There is something deeply wrong and immoral about this way of thinking. The idea that you alone get to value someone else's work output to be zero and then take that output and claim it has no value, and that the taking causes no harm."
"It is theft. But you don't want to be called a thief. So you play semantic games."
"If I take your brownie that's a brownie you can no longer sell or eat, this isn't the case when you copy software. If they stole a brownie you threw in the trash would you still call them a thief?"
"But you didn't copy the music and then delete it. You enjoyed it. There was a gain on one side and nothing exchanged for that gain. The lack of reciprocity is the root issue."
"Enjoyment was never part of the transaction anyway. I can't get a refund from a movie because I didn't like it."
"But you're just quibbling over word choice instead of actually engaging with the core of the moral argument I've made."
"Either you can't see the moral argument, which leads me to believe you really are unable to see that piracy is theft. Or you simply don't want to see it and then I fall back to think this is motivated ignorance."
Your whole argument is quibling over word choice, wanting to call pirates thieves even though there are distinct differences.
"And yet you still won't engage with the core argument about the immorality of violating the principle of reciprocity. I get it. You think I'm wrong. You have to either make an attempt to change my mind or simply stop replying."
"If you don't care to engage with the idea then I don't care to continue."
"Yes I think it's wrong, I'll agree with you on that. I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as stealing though."
"It is theft of service.  Same as if you went in for a haircut, and didn't pay for it.  You just stole the service provider's time.  The only difference with copyrighted works is that the multi-million dollar price tag on it is divided up among all the people who purchase it."
he harm caused is that you are denying the copyright owner their legal monopoly rights on distributing copies, therefore devaluing their virtual asset.
"> It is theft of service. Same as if you went in for a haircut, and didn't pay for it. You just stole the service provider's time."
What does matter is marginal cost of providing service. In this case it is ZERO. So no, it is not stealing. Nowhere close.
"Ok, so let's break this down a bit further, and have a world without copyrights."
ay that I have an idea for a copyrightable work.  It is going to take me one year to create it, working 8 hours a day.  To make it simple, put a price of my time at $100,000 for that one year.
"Now I could find someone to give me $100,000 as a fee for creating that work (assume that I have no other desire to make it for myself, so I would only do that if someone pays me).  But now the problem is, to almost any potential customer, that work is only worth $10.00.  So it doesn't get created."
Or, I could find 10,000 people to each give me $10.00 in advance to make it.  Now this is in the realm of possibility.  Kind of like the Kickstarter model.  But now everyone either has to pay in advance, then wait a year to receive it.  Or sign a legally binding contract that they owe $10.00 each once the product is delivered.  This all adds friction to the system.
"Can we invent some technique to remove this friction?  How about, I'm willing to take a chance on the popularity of my work, and build it in advance.  I really don't know how many people are interested -- it might be 10,000; maybe 5,000 or possibly 50,000.  So with copyright, I can safely take that chance -- over time, if I create enough works, some may lose (not be popular enough), some may win big (and I make much more than the time I put into it).  As long as it averages out, society in general is better off (assuming you think it is worthwhile for the works to exist to begin with -- I'm guessing this is true, otherwise you wouldn't be interested in obtaining it to begin with)."
ow, does anyone have any other models (I mentioned the Kickstarter model already) that can equally reduce the above-mentioned friction?  That is, allowing a creator to take a chance on making something in advance, and then on average extracting the fair fee for everyone who wants that service?
> Can we invent some technique to remove this friction?
o you disagree only with the term 
? Do you believe  there is anything wrong with the behavior?
"IP law needs to be reformed. It's deeply immoral in both general idea and implementation. Royalties should not be a thing, period. We are not in medieval England anymore, we as a society have ways of providing patronage that does not involve state violence. Apart from that there are live performances (which feed like 99% of artists)."
"And I don't really care about mega-production Hollywood. It can burn today if I care."
Given the laws we have today, do you believe there is anything wrong with the behavior?
"People doing business on someones content - no, that's not OK."
Copying someones work for your own consumption? Nothing is wrong with such behavior. Nor with non-commercial sharing. Not until you have disposable income. Then consuming and not chipping in is meh.
"Legal positivism is has it's stronger sides, but this is victimless crime."
I think it\'s really important to be upfront with saying what you believe is wrong. It makes it really easy for people to dismiss an argument when all they read is "no, it is not stealing", particularly in this domain. It\'s too easy to roll this in with those who don\'t want to pay for anything, that all content should be free. You\'re arguing something different, which isn\'t clear until someone else digs down. I think you do yourself a disservice in doing so.
"I don't think whether or not you have disposable income is an important discriminant. Who decides whether you have enough disposable income to justify paying for content?"
"I think there are a lot of issues with laws regarding intellectual property and content. Even though I disagree with them, I don't think flouting those laws is right or some sort of civil disobedience."
"Same with copying someone's work for personal use or non-commercial sharing. The existing framework is the one we've got, and there are currently ways authors or content providers can make it clear that they are willing to do so: Creative Commons licenses are one example. Likewise with other patronage models, such as Patreon. In other cases, you're benefitting from their work without them receiving compensation. There's no agreed upon transaction. Whatever term is used to describe it, I don't think it's right."
"If you wouldn't have otherwise purchased the content there is no loss."
"Granted, you're not the parent I was referring to, but let me ask again: Do you believe there is anything wrong with the behavior?"
"I'm not the parent you were referring to either, but my view is that 1) yes, shamelessly 'pirating' is at the very least a moral gray area, and in my opinion on darker side of this area, and 2) calling it stealing is a gross oversimplification."
"Concerning 2): many people I know who pirate, say, a particular show, would simply not watch if piracy was not available. On the other hand, once this show becomes easily available and accessible on something like Netflix, these same people happily pay for the content. It seems inaccurate and dishonest to call them 'thieves' by the conventional definition."
"tl;dr: I wouldn't defend piracy in most cases (you could just not watch the show), but I think calling someone doing this a 'thief' is a morally worse because of what that words means to most of us."
"So to go back to derekp7's analogy, if I wouldn't have otherwise purchased the haircut, then there's no loss to the barber?"
"This is a poor analogy anyways because time is money for most intents and purposes. Making a copy of a file doesn't cost anyone time or money as the work in question has already been created and the time has already been spent."
o, because the barber had to expend effort and resources on you.
If I copy all your emails and financial records have I harmed you?
re you only harmed if I remove your access to those records?
"That's yet a different issue. Watching an old episode of Seinfeld does not violate anyone's privacy."
heft: you have a painting. I took it.
Copyright infringement: You painted a painting. I took a picture of it and sold/gave away prints to all my friends.
Violation of privacy: I got into your phone and looked at all your dick pics.
Warrantless search: The police got into your phone and looked at all your dick pics, possibly finding evidence of a crime.
hey are different issues which can look similar at times, but are actually completely separate. Pretending like they are is just adding muck to this discussion.
Piracy: You have a ship. I climbed aboard, murdered some of your crew, and took control of your ship or stole some of your belongings.
nglish words admit to multiple, distinct definitions.
"Yes, that's completely the same thing as downloading a movie illegally."
"That's an invasion of privacy and violates all kinds of laws and ethical standards."
"If you reproduce my song without my consent, that's a violation of a very specific law which allows me a temporary* restriction on your rights. The ethical question raised, I think, is of a very different nature."
"I'd say that by simply copying and reading those emails and financial records you haven't done any harm. If you've used the knowledge gained from those documents to deprive someone of their finances(theft) or any such malicious action I'd say you've harmed the owner of these documents."
"Disclaimer: I do not condone piracy, I just believe you've made a logical fallacy."
"These arguments always comes up in these types of discussions. In reality though personal information has far less protection than commercial information. If you take nude pictures of yourself you might as well keep your credit card in frame, since that's essentially the only way someone would be sentenced for copying them later."
o. If you begin committing identity theft, Yes.
"'hacker' has also changed meanings.  There isn't much you can do about it.  That's the nature of language."
"Copyright infringement isn't theft, it's counterfeiting.  It's 100X worse because instead of just stealing some physical items like a television, it's devaluing the television to the point where it can no longer be sold."
It certainly can still be sold, just look at music. The industry recaptured a lot of people through a combination of affordable DRM free purchases and easy-to-use streaming. Video is getting there, they just allowed license restrictions and greedy pricing get in the way.
"It's not that people wont pay for media content, it's that they won't allow rent seeking behavior to stifle cultural innovation and enjoyment."
I view trying to silo culture to extract maximal rent as considerably worse than taking away their artificial monopoly in response.
What if the copyrighted material was code instead of media?
"Suppose company A invests $500M in writing code for a major new product. Development finishes and they begin selling the product and slowly recouping their costs. Now, company B comes along and surreptitiously hacks into company A, copying their their source code (they haven't stolen the source code, only copied it). Company B now begins selling a copycat product for far less than A wants to charge, destroying A's ability to earn back its investment. Has company B committed a crime?"
Certainly company B let company A keep its source code, but by copying the source code it did not let company A keep its way of earning money.
hey hacked the other company (one crime) and infringed the copyright of the other company (second crime).
"But I think you've got a couple of holes in your simile. Source code is a much more powerful thing to have than the final product. I can't remember a time where a movie's entire set of footage and effects assets were leaked/stolen, and the equivalent of a movie being leaked is compiled binaries being leaked, and that happens all the time. I'd also judge "
> Certainly company B let company A keep its source code, but by copying the source code it did not let company A keep its way of earning money.
"And yet, companies still make software, movies, music. I'd be more worried if those businesses were made non-viable due to copyright infringement losses and more sympathetic if I thought something copyrighted today would exit copyright within my lifetime."
More equivalent argument: company A makes a product. Consumer A who would not pay the asking price for the product downloads the trial then sets their system clock back 10 years and uses that product for free for personal non-commercial enjoyment a few times over the course of a few years. They technically violated the license agreement but did not profit from their circumvention. They would not have otherwise paid the asking price, so a sale is not realistically lost.
Yes, copyright/patent infringement (depending on the exact details).
But there are circumstances that might mitigate how the public (and perhaps law) feels about that, eg, if company B bought a copy of the software and slightly modified it to work on a new operating sysem, then sold just the changed version.
ome people still believe in paying for value.
"But apparently not all people believe in charging for value, since a lot of shows, movies, etc. aren't available to stream."
"What good is half a season of something, especially if it's the second half? I've not watches shows just because there's no way to catch up to where the current Hulu/Netflix/Whatever offering was. Sometimes I'd pirate it, but sometimes I wasn't really sold enough on the premise to bother."
I wonder what the marketing department would think of that. "Your attempts to sell me something failed so hard, I refused to bother stealing it."
"Completely agree. It is frequently the media companies' unwillingness to sell to buyers on their own terms that leads to this problem. Additionally, the fact that most content is irrelevant to most buyers."
Obviously, the traditional model was designed to subsidize creating something for everyone. But, now, it has been subverted to improve margins by creating everything for everybody / lowest common denominator. On the off chance that it fits my tastes, I still have to buy the rest of the crap just to view what I want.
"I'll pay for content, but I want to be able to buy what I want. Content creators have always had a tough time monetizing the content vs the mode of delivery. You pay for the theater when you go to the movies, you pay for the bandwidth when you stream, you pay for the dvd printing when you buy a DVD. It would be nice if the licensing per item were fixed, and the mode of delivery were left up to the buyer."
Yep.  As Gave Newell says, "piracy is a service problem."
"Honestly, I think it's more than that, I think it's an economic problem. Our economic model no longer matches reality. We used to bake the costs of production into the cost of a unit, which makes sense for physical goods. That makes no sense with digital goods. 15 years ago things like Napster were supposed to be the wake-up call for that."
"Instead we chose to ignore that lesson, and now we're collectively suffering for it today."
"I agree completely. I don't have cable, but I pay for SlingTV, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and CBS All Access. If a tv series isn't on one of those platforms, I will find it somewhere else. But I won't pay $30 for one tv series."
"I will make the argument I always make when this comes up: it's not stealing it's depriving rights holders of potential revenue. But it's really not because the market value of the content is approaching $0. That is, if I can't watch an episode of Buffy for free, I won't pay for it. I just won't watch it. This the cost I'm willing to pay is exactly $0. Therefore they lose no revenue."
"If you are uncomfortable with that mental gymnastics, here is a slightly less harsh approach. I currently pay for Netflix, HBO Now, Spotify, and Audible. So I am willing to pay $40-50/month for access to high quality commercial-free content on unlimited basis. But back when iTunes was the only option for streaming at something like $1/episode and $5/movie, I would not dream of it. So I guess the cost I am willing to pay is not quite $0 per each piece of content, but it's definitely not $20 each. I think a market adjustment is coming for content producers because I do believe lots of people have similar price points."
By the same token, when I go to say (Forbes.com), the advertisers are stealing bandwidth from me.  Unless I use an adblocker, the ads use bandwidth 
hen after I install an adblocker, they complain that 
nd that\'s ignoring all of the arguments around artificial monopolies, and the perverting of the copyright system through the "immortal mouse".
> Because it is stealing. Some people still believe in paying for value.
"I'll care about people stealing from an oligopoly when people care about regulating natural monopolies and oligopolies to the point they behave reasonably."
"It's not stealing, it's unauthorized copying. And I'm pretty sure retail end-user pirates don't go to jail."
"In any case, the moral argument doesn't appear to work. People just don't care."
"> In any case, the moral argument doesn't appear to work."
Why would it work? You could equally successfully try to shame people into not breathing without payment.
"There's no reason to think it would work, but that doesn't stop people from shouting it every time someone discusses the reasons why people pirate."

Maybe if it were called "copying" instead of "piracy" (on the high seas).
"It is better to not go to jail than to feed one's entertainment lust."
"While I agree with your post overall that ideally the end consumer shouldn't access such content illegally, the days of the end user going to jail or being fined over illicit downloads are long gone. The content companies and the governments finally woke up to the reality that going after those who profit from making the content available, rather than the end user, is the correct thing to do. As the GP said, people will naturally take the easiest path, and often downloading a TV episode from an illicit source is easier than attempting to purchase it legally (for some shows one must subscribe to as many as four streaming services to get all seasons/series)."
"All of that said, it really is a game of whack-a-mole the governments and content companies are playing by going after the little guys distributing the content. Just as with the war on drugs and the war on terrorism, it's a war that will never be won."
o much hyperbole. The article refers to people selling preloaded piracy boxes for profit, which is different than setting up your own.
Criminal courts are no place for regulating copyright infringement much like combating drug use. It is just as likely to worsen the problem, be more expensive than the alternative, or cause a variety of harmful externalities neutralizing the net benefit (for ex: slowing R&D).
"You can argue about whether to call it stealing but it is breaking the law. It's shocking to me the way so many people, especially in the generation after me, have proudly abandoned any pretense to morals or ethics. Sure GenX has its share of amoral people, but at least they had the good taste to lie about it. I mean, that's kind of admitting that morality is important"
You can consider copyright infringement wrong and simultaneously believe criminalizing it as theft is a bad idea.
"For example jay-walking is wrong because it's dangerous but many people do it anyway and it's not generally villianized. So then is the solution having police patrols in the streets fining/arresting people as a deterance? Will that reduce the problem and legitimately help both pedestrians and drivers? Or will educating people on the risks, creating alternatives such as adding more crossing points, improving cars ability to detect pedestrians, etc, etc, be a better solution?"
ot everything is black or white, good or bad.
"I'm think simultaneously improving pedestrian facilities while making penalties on jaywalking harsh is an okay idea, especially if the goal is 100% compliance."
What if you just noticed that there are already tunnels under all the roads?
"Is it then immoral to walk under the road when some people interpret that as technically jay walking even though you're not directly effecting anyone in the way that the law assumes you will?"
"It's a bad analogy but I'll try to play along:"
he tunnels are private property, with a sign saying "Private Property - Do Not Enter", and nothing gives you the inherent right to use them.
I made no statement about whether or to what extent the law should punish this.
"> You can argue about whether to call it stealing but it is breaking the law. It's shocking to me the way so many people, especially in the generation after me, have proudly abandoned any pretense to morals or ethics"
"You're conflating laws and morality. Wouldn't it make more sense that the people pirating movies don't see it as morally wrong, instead of people pirating movies because they are amoral?"
"No, I'm not. I'm making two different statements about related aspects of the same act. I'm surprised, but shouldn't be by the down votes in this thread and the disturbing responses. You guys do in fact proudly believe it is right to steal someone else's work product"
"> It's shocking to me the way so many people, especially in the generation after me, have proudly abandoned any pretense to morals or ethics. Sure GenX has its share of amoral people, but at least they had the good taste to lie about it. I mean, that's kind of admitting that morality is important"
"You are either saying saying society is more immoral now (which is irrelevant and off-topic), or saying the piracy is immoral, which is debatable. But then you don't provide any points to back up your argument."
"Your first sentence, that piracy is illegal, is true but also besides the point of morality. Slavery was legal for a long time and I'm pretty sure we can all agree it was not moral just because it was legal. Apparently it's illegal to have an ice cream cone in your back pocket in Alabama, does that immediately make it immoral?"
You keep calling it stealing, which it is not. If you want to bring legality into the debate, piracy is legally not stealing. Loaded words like that do nothing to help a discussion.
"> You guys do in fact proudly believe it is right to steal someone else's work product"
"And where are you getting this info? I haven't pirated anything for years and am generally against it. I certainly don't believe it's anyone's right to do so. I bet many people here feel the same way."
"However at the same time, realistically, I don't believe piracy is causing as much harm as anyone makes it out to be. Anecdotally, I don't know anyone who pirates things or has pirated things that would have purchased it otherwise. They just don't view/listen to/use the thing."
Often the most successful software products are the ones with the highest piracy rates. Anti-piracy measures generally screw over the average consumer more than they screw over pirates.
I liken it to jay-walking. Is it illegal? Sure. Is it bad in some circumstances? Sure. Should we dedicate a giant task force to jaywalking, create city streets that have anti-jaywalking barriers, and lock up anyone who does it? That would do more harm than good.
"> Sure GenX has its share of amoral people, but at least they had the good taste to lie about it. I mean, that's kind of admitting that morality is important."
"If that's your morality then everyone after GenX surely dodged a bullet. You'd prefer someone act like a psychopath rather than admit they don't agree with your moral code."
"It\'s shocking to me the way so many people, especially in the generation after me, have proudly abandoned any pretense to morals or ethics."
"Not moral or ethics? I don't think so. Do you mean different morals and ethics that yours, maybe?"
hat comment about the new generations is so old as the first generation, by the way.
o you ever speed? Did you ever drink before legal age? Most people [citation needed] think of pirating a song or a movie as being on that level, if at all.
"Huh? My dad who is 65 now was proudly buying illegal cable descramblers in the 80s and bragging to all his friends about it, who would then go on to buy descramblers of their own. Since then he's moved on to Napster, Kazaa, Moviebox, Popcorn time, and Kodi."
h yes, the old, "my one counterexample totally refutes your hyperbolic generalization response". I\'ll try to remember to include a paragraph full of statistical disclaimers the next time I contribute a generalization to an internet discussion

"If there's a specific law they're breaking, I'd be surprised."
I\'m not sure about the UK where these arrests occurred, but in the US it might fall afoul of the "making available" concept of US copyright law. In other words, the original content creator has the exclusive right to make the content available for public consumption, whether by paid or free streaming or download, and any other entity that makes the content available is in violation of copyright law. I\'d be interested in the outcome of an arrest over Kodi boxes here in the States, especially if it were challenged all the way up to the Supreme Court, as the "loaded Kodi box" guys are not streaming the content themselves, only providing an easy path (and profiting).

"It looks like the law stems from European Directive 2001/29/EC (2001) [2][3]. That directive isn't law in itself, it's an instruction for the EU member states to implement law to deliver that directive (in fact, the UK were initially convicted of failing to implement it by the 2002 deadline)."
t a guess, the relevant law is the 
"But the article seems to say that the Kodi software itself doesn't allow piracy, it's just software that third parties have written add-ons to, and those third-party add-ons give access to pirated content."
"If that's actually the case, then it's hard for me to see how selling the fully-loaded Kodi box is more illegal than selling a computer with an internet connection. After all, there's third party software for computers that give access to pirated content as well, right?"
It probably depends somewhat on how these devices are marketed. I was in a resturaunt last year where a salesperson was showing one of these boxes to the resturaunt owners, he had it hooked up to the TV and he was accessing pirated content while claiming it was "included" in the price of the box ($499!) and "completely legal". Definitely questionable.
"Yes, I think that's the key distinction.  Kodi is available (for example) in the Play Store so selling a box with it pre-installed is not illegal.  However, if you go the extra step and include the piracy add-ons and (potentially) a subscription IPTV service then you've overstepped the line."

"I'm curious about this. If there was a public poll, my guess is that the public would be overwhelmingly against sending people to prison for copyright violation. There's some evidence to support this [0]."
"In fact, I think it's a fact that shows just how messed up the law is. That people can be overwhelmingly against harsh penalties for copyright violation, yet they still exists..."
Because the general public at large is not the one suffering from copyright violation? The affected parties are the ones that should be polled; but I agree that we might not agree on who is really affected.
Clearly copyright violation has an affect on all parties involved.

I _do_ want to pay for these services, but they need to provide value.

ure I could spend time figuring it all out again, but that takes time and effort. So I end up buying stuff.
"They'll never stop all piracy. They just want to make sure the masses don't know how to easily pirate. It's an 80/20 situation."
"I'm just going to leave this HN submission that got into the front page a little while ago here... It's not the same as a full fledged tracker, but for that YIFI movie that everybody has seen, it's nice."
"There are plenty of vpn we don't keep any logs services that you can run a torrent through - at that point it doesn't matter how safe the tracker is."
It takes a little bit of time for other trackers to gain traction. Right now I think the most promising public tracker I know is idope.se, enjoy :)
Why tracker? You can find most stuff using Google and various file sharing services.
I was having a hell of a time finding ebooks for my wife just googling for it. I had to download IRC. Total blast from the past. I learned how to do it, but it took a while.
You\'re falling for the "Kodi is only a piracy platform" myth. You can certainly use Kodi for viewing things you\'ve recorded over-the-air (which is my own use case), without resorting to pirated media.
"Thank you. People like to hate on Kodi but really it's the add-ons. People love open software, but they hate on the devs of kodi even though they kick and scream about these add ons (and even added a toggle to not allow add ons by default.) My web browser can be used for piracy, but you don't see people hating Mozilla. It's silly."
"Not only that, but my Kodi server is basically my client portfolio and my home movie repository. I can upload home movies and just tell my parents, who live on the other side of the country, to refresh Kodi and they get to see the latest videos of their grandkids. With clients, I physically go to client locations and pitch them and I can show them previous spots that I've done, in person and on my iPad, without making them publicly available and potentially violating contracts and agreements that I have."
Or  even other (scraped) content from legal sources/addons. My personal usecase is essentialy watching /r/video and my YouTube subscriptions from couch with a unified interface.
he Nasa and Esa addons are pretty nifty.
"I used to pay for a hulu subscription, because even with a few ads it was really convenient. Now, there are less of the shows I want to watch, and the ads are absolutely, insultingly ridicululous. It will seriously play 10 minutes of ads in 5 minute increments for a 20 minute show. Every ad block is now 3 advertisements long, some of them require you to interact, and every show has at least 3 breaks for ads. Sometimes it'll run ads AFTER the show ends so you watch ads to see the credits, or in order to see the next episode! They have literally made streaming worse than regular TV and after this weekend I finally had enough and just installed Kodi."
> 10 minutes of ads in 5 minute increments for a 20 minute show
"> Sometimes it'll run ads AFTER the show ends so you watch ads to see the credits, or in order to see the next episode!"
lso just like broadcast TV.  The horror!!!
> They have literally made streaming worse than regular TV
"Sounds more like they've just foolishly brought the worst of broadcast to the web."
"I'm sure you realize Hulu has an ad-free option, right?  So in order to save yourself the $2-$3 it would cost you to go ad-free on hulu you've decided to just take it instead.  Why? Because you deserve to get it for free? Does Hollywood simply exist to entertain you at no cost?"
"That's a hell of a sense of entitlement you've got yourself there kiddo..."
o now broadcast TV should be our benchmark for quality customer experiences? Yeah, "the horror," I didn\'t switch to streaming to get the exact same problems.
"I'm a long time Hulu subscriber, and when I signed up the amount of advertising in a given program was MUCH more reasonable and there were more shows available. The quality of service has actively degraded over time since I became a customer, and their solution was to offer a more expensive option that does not actually remove ads, since plenty of shows still have them. Frankly, I feel like I am entitled to some free TV at this point, for the sheer volume of advertising Hulu has gradually warmed me into thinking is reasonable to be exposed to in a 20 minute program. It shouldn't take 40 minutes to get through an episode of Daria."
hat gets to a point I left out of my original post - I really wouldn\'t mind spending a couple more bucks if I could still watch the shows I originally signed up for, but Hulu is now removing most of the old programming I like (Daria, Chapelle\'s Show, etc). Their original programming is clearly not as good as they seem to think it is and three melodramatic shows about weird psychics doesn\'t make up for the programming I actually want to watch, which is now literally only available on DVD or on Kodi. Hollywood doesn\'t exist to entertain me at no cost but there\'s literally nothing for me to "just pay for."
"You've conveniently skipped the mention of ads that require interaction, which is far worse."
> $2-$3 it would cost you to go ad-free
It appears to cost $12,and apparently only removes ads on some shows... so, no.
"That's a hell of a sense of superiority you've got yourself there kiddo..."
I believe the "$2-$3" was intended to be the difference between the with-ads subscription ($8), and the without-ads subscription ($12).
It would be more honest to call it the "packed full of ads" subscription and the "no ads on some things, but still a few ads on anything you probably want to watch" subscription.
"> > Sometimes it'll run ads AFTER the show ends so you watch ads to see the credits, or in order to see the next episode!"
> Also just like broadcast TV. The horror!!!
"Broadcast TV has a workaround - the DVR/timeshifting.  Does anyone worth monetizing not use DVRs?  I simply don't have the time to watch a show with ads."
"My aging parents who have about 1/5 my income combined do watch without the DVR, but they also are stingy and don't need anything."
obody relevant watch broadcast tv with ads.
Your example of Netflix having only half a season and then having to add a second subscription service to watch the rest is a straw man.
It feels more like "I already pay for Netflix, so why do I have to pay anyone else for content Netflix doesn\'t have?" That\'s a bit like asking why you should pay for CNN 
"There is a large number of TV shows and movies that is not available on any streaming service. There is also a large number that's available, but only from a very specific content provider. For example last I checked, Seinfeld was only available on I think TBS's website, with an awful Flash-based player and really intrusive commercials. Oh, and what was available was something like a set of 5 rotating episodes, not the whole thing. Another example is Conan the Destroyer (been on an Arnold kick lately) which as far as I saw could only be purchased on BluRay or DVD."
I am not saying the content providers owe anyone a streaming option. But grandparent is right about path of least resistance.
Your example actually highlights the problem with cable. There is no way to get \xe2\x80\x93 say, only HBO, ESPN, and no CNN.
Cable would force OP to buy 37 useless channels whose content is being subsidized by people paying for the 5 channels they actually watch.
anish cable companies have very recently begun to offer mix your own channel packages (I assume some channels costs more) that was great for me because I called up my provider and finally got them to give me just an internet connection.
"It's not actually. Just as one example there was a series I started watching on Netflix, got through the first season, started watching the second, and then it disappeared off Netflix. For various reasons a lot of series aren't being carried by Netflix anymore (it's about a 50/50 split as to whether Netflix or the content producers are to blame). In order to finish off the second season I had to either skip a bunch of episodes and come in on the tail end of the second season on Hulu (because they don't have anything but the most recent episodes of the current season), wait until the next season started airing and watch the full second season then, or else pay Amazon to purchase the streaming for the entire season (this was in addition to the cost of the prime membership already being paid for)."
"OP was right, streaming services are fractured and disjointed right now and nobody offers everything. Netflix has shifted primarily to their own content and increasingly only carries independent and foreign films and shows. Hulu is an ad packed disaster area on top of having a horrible streaming experience on current content designed to try to prop up the failing cable subscription model. Amazon is the best bet for most other content but is of course the most expensive of all the options since it isn't a proper subscription service like Netflix or Hulu but instead more closely emulates the Blockbuster Video model of old. None of the options is a really fully satisfying replacement for a cable TV subscription, but each is just good enough that it's still better than cable TV. In aggregate, the experience is definitely the best option, but it's still really frustrating (not to mention expensive) to constantly need to juggle between the three major services (and the dozens of smaller ones) in order to access the content you want when you want it."
etflix has shifted primarily to their own content and increasingly only carries independent and foreign films and shows.
"Yeah.  They don't have everything I want to watch, but they have enough decent stuff that I find something interesting easily enough."
"I am slightly cheesed when something I was watching was taken off before I finished it... I understand why they don't advertise when they'll loose the rights to a particular show, but I'd sure like some way to know how long some shows will be available."
"To the movie industry, here are my demands: high quality, DRM free downloads of MKV files, with nice subtitles, multiple audio tracks, etc, that can be purchased using only open source software on the client. I won't settle for anything less. That's what the competetion offers."
o add insult to injury, the competition often delivers this experience 
"But the people I hired can\'t do that, and the people who can do it don\'t want to work for me".
"Oh, I'll totally build it for you, movie companies. My email's in my profile."
"Hey! When we (educated technologists) are talking about this, let's make sure to recognize that Kodi is just a media playing customized gnu/linux."
"Let's not besmirch Kodi, it's really a shining example of successful non-commercial open source."
"I have used Kodi with software such as Sickrage to download tv shows but with Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions alongside iPlayer that covers the majority of shows we watch. The Raspberry Pi running Sickrage is now rarely used whereas the PS4 running Netflix is used most evenings. As you say, it's the path of least resistance."
Piracy is about wanting stuff for free. Nothing more and nothing less.
"Piracy isn't a convenience problem. It's a not wanting to spend money for things problem."
"I've built up quite a digital collection on iTunes, all purchased more than 4 years ago when I realised my investment in content was completely locked to the iTunes platform, with no legal means to transfer the purchased content to other platforms. For some movies I paid the same price as a Blu-ray disk, for lower quality and vendor lock-in. I refuse to invest any further money into content that I am only legally allowed to access on one vendors platform, so I purchase Blu-ray versions and keep a digital backup available that can be played on vendor strategy tax unencumbered software such as Emby and Kodi. Itunes, Google Play, Amazon Movies, non of these are viable options."
">Piracy isn't a convenience problem. It's a not wanting to spend money for things problem."
xcept the likes of iTunes and Steam have shown that if you provide an affordable, reliable and convenient distribution channel, people will flock to it over the napster/kazaa/torrent alternatives.
hen why do some people currently pirate 
"Because the things they pirate cost more than they feel it's worth. So they just take a free copy instead."
But that doesn\'t answer my question. If "Piracy is about wanting stuff for free. Nothing more and nothing less", then why would someone who 
Because they find the price agreeable and wish to reward the rights holder. If they found the price disagreeable then they pirated despite wishing the content holder to be rewarded.
Or buy it and wait hours to download it?
How it it streamable on Kodi, but takes so long to download from a legitimate source?
Personally I think the entertainment industry is approaching the pirating issue the wrong way.
"They should all be looking into expanding their web tech. Serve ad's to people that want to watch your content for free, have a pay service for those that don't want ad's."
"On the other hand I had sky... I paid \xc2\xa370 a month which is A LOT compared to netflix etc, and everytime I wanted to watch something I had to be served with 3 x 1:30' ad' sessions for a 20' episode of friends... I mean why do I even pay if you going to serve me intrusive ad's. No thank you, I prefer having netflix and amazon prime that has a lot to watch and if I want something specifically that isn't available to those 2 am gonna torrent it like a boss."
"I don't understand what's so hard about putting their whole film catalog online. Let me pay a buck to download any movie your studio produced in some simple format without any crapware or subscriptions or region-locking and I will do so every time instead of pirating."
"The marginal cost of offering a movie for downloading must be pretty close to 0. Why can't studios simply tap the opportunity of cheap hassle-free downloads?"
tudios sign different distribution deals in different regions. These include box office release and "DVD" (web) release schedules. These regional licensing contracts are often in the range of 5-7 years.
s a result, studios cannot simply offer a film or TV series online at the same time for everybody. As the regional contracts expire and the studios restructure them, I expect to see more direct distribution via online channels.
"As much as I'd like to believe that it's going to get better, in my experience it's getting worse."
"Instead of consolidating and simplifying their terms, they are digging deeper and getting more complex. It's not uncommon to see a setup like:"
"And that's just in one country, not even taking into account the various restrictions and petty limitations like no HD and no ability to rewind or even pause in some cases. Not to mention the hardware you'd need to watch all of that on a regular TV. You are looking at least at a Fire-stick, Roku or chromecast, a STB from the cable company, and in some cases a PC that can HDMI over to the TV."
"I suspect they value the offering higher if it's in limited supply."
isney do this with the Disney Vault[1].
ach Disney film is available for purchase for a limited time, after which it is put "in the vault" and not made available in stores for several years until it is once again released.
However, Disney may be the exception here.
"They've made this web for themselves, by lobbying for longer and more restrictive copyright."
he most pathetic irony here, is Disney, who made a small fortune milking public domain fairy-tales and yet have fought to prevent their extremely popular figures to become part of that same public domain - even after they clearly 
Like, I pay $5, I get the official .torrent link legally? 
Have them set up private trackers with dedicated seedboxes and add a "tip a buck for this movie" button with some a convenient payment processor. Technologically it\'s a weekend project for a small team and I really don\'t see what they lose financially.
"I really don't see what they lose financially"
here is no way that a torrent with a $1 tip function would make the same amount of money they make through all the distribution deals, advertising, $6 24-hour HD rentals through cable providers and Amazon, etc.
"Technologically it's a weekend project for a small team"
"On top of top of pc86's reasoning, a lot of small payment methods like this get abused for credit card fraud. Get a list of a thousand CC numbers from somewhere shady, and test them all out on small $1 donations like this. If it succeeds, the card is valid and the owner likely won't notice anytime soon. Eventually, when they do cancel the card and order chargebacks, the company has to pay a large flat fee to refund that $1. This is also why a lot of OSS projects don't have donation options."
"It's also a liability magnet.  The MAFIAA already wants to nuke free-for-all pirating, but if you make money off that? Easier to find, and prosecute."
"It's not hard, it's just not maximized profit. There's a lot of brain power invested in how much they can charge and how much advertising they can cram into content, finding the most profitable balance between acquiring, retaining and losing viewers."
"This isn't canonically true is it; if more people consume more media at $1 per go you could make back much more than you loose by charging \xc2\xa325 that very few people pay for new Blu ray disks."
How sure are you that more than 25X people will pay for a 1 dollar movie? Because that sounds way high to me.
"Do you know anyone would watch 25X more content if it were cheaper? I wouldn't."
nd the movie industry taps this demand in other ways. They eventually sell the movie to netflix/amazon/tv station.
">Do you know anyone would watch 25X more content if it were cheaper? I wouldn't."
"They don't need to watch more, just start paying for what they watch."
"Until it's tried no-one can be sure either way... most people would have thought Spotify was a crazy idea until someone made it happen..."
here are real costs to just trying it. People have an idea of what media is "worth." If you set the price too low, it\'s nearly impossible to get it up higher.
"It's been hard to get people to accept iOS apps should be more than a 99 cents."
he whole of DVD and BluRay sales is a poultry 13bn dollars
o I guess your ideas about the App Store are wrong or cheap yields loads of revenue...  Hey, when selling more is essentially free sell more, right?
Just to hate on AMP a little more it took me 3-4 times longer to unampify the bloody URLs on those links.
"It's also about effort per buck earned."
 single exclusive deal for a season of Game of Thrones for a specific release window with a local/regional PayTV provider brings in, say, ten million bucks. And you make this deal in a nice 3 Michelin Star restaurant.
Compare that with actually delivering 10 million streams to end users, on iPhones, iPads, Androids, AppleTVs, Chromecasts, [edited: with] payment gateways and support for technically challenged people.
elivering 10m streams to the end user is a solved problem; just pay to transcode your video.  The point is to avoid even streaming - let people download films, no drm, for a buck (maybe 2 bucks for 4k) and trust most people not to steal.
oes it make sense financially for them to divide markets and then play the broadcasters off for exclusive rights to show films on scheduled TV.
"I would love to have the possibility to be able to hassle free download movies, and I would be willing to pay up to 5 bucks (for certain movies) to do so. But I don't have that option, so instead I have other ways of getting my movies."
> Personally I think the entertainment industry is approaching the pirating issue the wrong way.
"I think the big problem going forward will be peoples willingness to pay. Just look at the current landscape of OTT services and people are beginning to get annoyed over paying for so many. I personally don't think the individual OTT market will keep pushing forward the way it is because at some people will get fed up with paying for so many different services. And while you can cancel at anytime, who wants to deal with remembering to sign up and cancel every time a new show comes along? Never mind the annoyance of traversing in and out of services to watch different shows or watchlists -- this by the way is where I feel TiVO got it right by combining regular recordings with online."
My hope and likely dream scenarios is we begin to see a shift away from TV distributed over COAX and proprietary boxes, and instead consumed through services like Vue / SlingTV. These platforms advance to being more than traditional delivery mechanisms by allowing integration of OTT services to be consumed like a regular channel.
"The entertainment industry isn't stupid. They are doing their best to maximize revenues from their products given the current landscape of cable networks, streaming providers, on-demand, etc."
he ability to make bolder strategy choices is also hampered by the need to enter into distribution contracts with the above-mentioned providers.
"If you do the math, I'd guess revenues would be higher doing what the entertainment industry currently does than what you propose. While this will lead many people into pirating, it's still likely a pretty small percentage."
etflix did $8.8 billion in revenue last year. U.S. domestic box office receipts were around $11.3 billion and were around $30 billion globally.
"In the US alone, given Netflix' current subscriber base of 49 million, it would cost each subscriber would have to pay a little over $19 per month extra just to make up for domestic box office revenues. When you factor in that Netflix needs to make some money on top of that, as well as whatever scaling is necessary, that number needs to go up even further. And then you need to makeup all the additional money that comes from rentals and distribution deals outside of  Netflix. There is a reason why Netflix only gets a small portion of quality movies -- because companies can make more signing deals with companies other than Netflix."
"Would most people be willing to pay over $100 per month for an all-you-can-eat movie service? I doubt it, considering that doesn't even account for all the television programming, which takes up a much larger portion of people's screen time than movies do. First-run television content earns a lot of revenue, as do live shows, particularly sports. ESPN alone costs cable companies $7 per subscriber and that's with lots of ad-supported content. Without ad support, that number would be closer to $12 and that doesn't account for the additional production costs to make up for all the additional airtime that needs filled."
"I think to truly create an all-you-can-eat, comprehensive entertainment streaming service, you'd be look at several hundred dollars per month in subscription fees. And you'd still have to figure out some sort of way to incentivize content producers to continue producing the same level of content they currently do and support competition so there is a continued push towards higher quality."
o 100% of "box office receipts" go to the production company?  Or is a portion of that overhead for the theater showing the movie?
lso I think you\'re really missing something important, which the entertainment industry is also ignoring... "all you can eat" is not the only way to do it, there is a market for "a la carte" as well.  My wife has been trying to find a way to pay to stream 3 or 4 TV channels only, she specifically does not want to pay for ESPN or other trash television we won\'t watch.  It would be even better if we could find it without ads.  Of course such a model is probably unthinkable for content producers that want to bundle their losers in with their winners in order to boost their value.
"I don't think theaters make much, if anything at all, from ticket receipts. That's why concession are so overprice. Some theaters even flat-out tell you this."
I think the "a la carte" model is much more realistic than the "all you can eat" model but I don\'t think that model solves what the parent comment was saying. The a la carte model doesn\'t really work that well for movies either. I still think people would complain and go to torrents. "Why should I pay $15 a month to watch Game of Thrones when I can torrent it?" will still be a question but that\'s already better than things were two years ago when it was "Why do I have to pay a $70 cable subscription PLUS $15 a month to watch Game of Thrones?"
heaters get an increasing percentage as the movie get\'s older.  First weekend they get ~0-25%, but they also fill the seats.  "after the fourth week when theatres generally can keep up to 80% or better of the ticket sales" However, the seats are mostly empty. 
"I would guess Hollywood get's around 80% of overall ticket sales, but it can very a lot.  However, production costs can be less than advertising costs.  So, the production side might get 60% of stated ticket sales and that's the percentage that Netflix would need to cover."
hat said, if Netflix had every movie ever for 25$ a month they would also likely have far more customers and probably be revenue neutral for Hollywood.  But, at the same time every studio would want a larger cut and the only way it would work is if there where similar rules for streaming movies as streaming songs.
>Do 100% of "box office receipts" go to the production company? Or is a portion of that overhead for the theater showing the movie?
ot 100% but a pretty high percentage given how much work the distribution & theatre companies do.
"But you'd also have to account for DVD/VOD/streaming/tv rights that movies also get aside from just theatre."
> There is a reason why Netflix only gets a small portion of quality movies -- because companies can make more signing deals with companies other than Netflix.
"Yet they can afford to pay Dave Chappelle $60 million for 3 episodes. I love Netflix, but it's clear they are focused on their own original content, and they do a great job at it. Every Netflix show I've watched is great. They don't have the latest and greatest movies because they choose not to buy them."
You assume that box office goes down to 0 if a movie can be downloaded easily. This is evidently not true, since most movies already can be download easily, just not legally.
Zero-day movies are nearly always CAMs or TS. They are a terrible experience.
"Streaming or downloading a full 4k version would mean I'd probably never go to the theater again (and I go roughly 12 times a year)."
ome people would still go for the social experience / big screen, but a lot less frequently. I bet most theatres would have to shut down.
Most movies can be downloaded easily by people who know to use computers. There are tens of millions of fully functional adult Americans who can barely operate Word, they certainly cannot start torrenting movies.
"Well, they might be able to once, at which point they're going to get some ransomware or become part of a botnet."
"If people aren't willing to pay $100 for an all you can eat movie service did it even cross your mind that it only means it's overpriced?"
I guess that makes sense, if you assume Netflix would not grow widely when they have everything.
"You are also assuming the rest of the entertainment complex isn't going to shrink, especially espn which is losing a lot of subscribers."
"Just get Now TV. Seriously. It's loads cheaper than regular Sky, is more flexible in its packages, and has no ads."
"I'd second this, up to a point - my GF has it (she changed from Sky), and it's half the price - \xc2\xa340 for her a month including broadband, etc.  My only gripe is that it seems a bit fragmented to me when using the box - there's not a universal UI which allows you to just access all the on demand content that's available, so you have to go into BBC, C4, or the NowTV app, etc..  If it was unified (somehow, I appreciate that's not easy or probably even possible) then I think it would be really hard to beat."
"I keep considering this but I don't want to add another streaming box on my living room or bedroom. I have a Fire TV precisely because of this."
"Can't you get the Now TV app on your Fire TV?"
Vimeo has a great platform that I think could be expanded to big budget / Hollywood film. They already abide by what seems to me a Bandcamp-meets-Spotify model but for video. I really think getting on a service such as Vimeo is the next logical step for film to take. Although, some in the industry may not be thrilled.
I must say the BBC article does a good job of explaining what a "fully loaded Kodi box" is, keeping it accessible without confusing things.
"What's different between selling one of these and selling, say a PC with Bittorrent and bookmarks to the movie section of the PirateBay pre-loaded (or whatever website people are using these days)?"
Intent. These people were selling a box with the specific intent to watch pirated movies. If you were to sell a PC that "just happened" to have links on it then I imagine no one would really bother with you. If you were advertising the PC as a "watch movies for free" PC then the Federation Against Copyright Theft would try to stop you.
But you do know that you can watch movies for free if you have internet and a general purpose computer, right? Why is it wrong to say that?
"Warning, this knife can sever arteries.". Is this better?
"Warning, this machine can access copyrighted content. Buy it at your own risk."
You seem to be trying to argue against the law. As onion2k says, courts consider intent. They will decide if you intended for your customers to break the law, and were complicit in the breaking of the law, or not.
hey will only consider real cases, not hypothetical.
> "Warning, this knife can sever arteries.". Is this better?
"The courts take things in context. If it was sold by a gangster with that wording used for the purpose of informing customers that it can be used to kill people, then that's one thing. If it's used as a warning label so that adults know to keep the knife away from their children for safety, that's another. Courts are not blind; they are "
"You seem to consider the law as some kind of mathematical function where the same input always results in the same output. This is indeed the aim, but context matters. The law doesn't ignore context, so you cannot expect to do so either."
You might find it helpful to read "What Colour are your bits?": 
hat article talks about copyright, but the point about the law seeing context, and the same nonsense conclusions when attempting to use logic but ignore context, remains the same.
"Yet another non-attorney on HN attempting to parse law as if it's code. It's common to point of it barely being worth discussing anything legal."
"Attorneys and courts have a wide berth with which to determine what a person's intent was. Instances where you can thumb your nose at basic jurisprudence and get off on a technicality of the text of the law is exceedingly rare."
"Rules are made because people want to break them. If everyone agreed, there would be no need for rules. Don't treat those who disagree as if they were wrong. They are just the reason those rules exist, one as legitimate as the other."
ee, you say one might get to "nonsense conclusions when attempting to use logic but ignore context", but you used "They will decide if you intended" without flinching. Or did you flinch?
"They will decide" I thought the intent was mine. How can my intent be decided? My intent was to kill time.
nd I have read "What Colour are your bits" before. "The trouble is, human beings are not in general Colour-blind." They are. Truth is, they are. There is no "Colour sense". You can\'t tell if this pipe was from your grandfather, mine, or if it was 3D printed 10 minutes ago. I could lie to you, you would believe it, and be Wrong. We pretend we see Colour. We tell each other the Colour of everything all the time, because we can\'t see it. Just as we pretend family matters, and borders exist, and anger is something we must act upon and the sky is up and the floor is down, and fashion is a thing. We pretend these things all the time. I sometimes pretend to want to work where I am right now.
"This idea of Colour is a problem for communication between those of us who work in the world of computers, where Colour does not exist, and those of us who work in the law, where Colour exists and is important." Colour does not exist anywhere. If everyone forgot it, no one would be able to find it again. Other Colours would be created. And we would pretend to like them with the same strength.
When you buy a combat knife, are you buying a killing artifact? Are you buying a weight? A memento of culture? Army supplies?
he world functions because we agree on a lot of things. You seem to agree that Colour exists and the Combat Knife is deadly, but the Americana Knife is not, and the metal assembly is just scrap. Only by force you will convince anyone that Colour exists and it is important. So you will never be right, you will just have won. And the Federation Against Copyright Theft won, and we pretend they are right. I disagree.

Yes, but these boxes are set up to only display media, and advertised as a way to watch copyrighted content without acquiring a subscription or license to the content.
ry advertising a butchers knife as "an excellent tool to slit the throats of <insert migrant minority here> pigs", or any less extreme but still illegal activity (like advertising nails for the purpose of puncturing the tires of your annoying neighbours car).
>Try advertising a butchers knife as "an excellent tool to slit the throats of <insert migrant minority here> pigs"
Judging by the manual for the Kershaw I bought, at least some manufacturers like to add reminders that the knife is meant to cut only letter envelopes and basically touching anything else with it will void your warranty...
I was going to elaborate on how we should close down classes about rocket science or anything particle physics related. You know, just in case someone manages to learn how to control fission and miniaturize it into bombs.
Combat is not illegal, per se. If they called it a "murder knife" you might have a point.
"It's not a warning that is in place. These sellers were advertising their Kodi boxes as a way to watch live football without paying or the latest movies for free. This so what attracted legal attention to their operations."
"It's one thing to sell a Vanilla Kodi box with no add-ons (i.e., a general purpose device) and something a whole lot different when it's got add-ons pre-installed that stream unauthorized copyrighted content."
"The authorities in Canada have been chasing down Android Box sellers at the behest of the cable companies for pretty much the same reason. Most of them come with Showbox installed and preloaded Kodi channels that are pretty shameless about where they're getting the streams from."
"One of the key points in the case is the way they are advertised as having access to subscription channels for free and they're pre-loaded with the apps to do so. Most of the articles make that distinction too."
If you start selling a PC loaded with that software that\'s advertised as "download La La Land and 100s of other new movies for free!", it\'s a different ballgame as the intent is clearly there.
"I do wonder how far it goes though, if you look at this listing, it's only implied that the illegal streaming services are on there, but it's pretty clear they are when you look at the customer questions:"
ot much. A person selling a PC preloaded with torrent clients and links to torrent sites, and advertising it as a way to breach copyrights, would possibly find themselves on the wrong end of this law. If anyone could be bothered to prosecute, that is.
hese boxes are advertised as a method of watching live football without paying. If you advertised and sold Jodi boxes without this claim you would be left alone but the copyright infringement is used as a sales tool hence the prosecution.
"Depends on the country you're dealing with, but distributing information on how to access illegal material is sometimes just as illegal as distributing the material itself."
"There's also probably an element of tax evasion involved."
"If you can't setup your own Kodi box, I don't know how in the world you would be sold one and actually use it. It isn't simple to setup and it is more complicated to maintain (for someone who couldn't just set one up themselves)."
"I think that's one of the big problems the Kodi team has with these 'fully loaded' boxes [1]."
People buy them and they work for a week, and then the streams break, etc. and these people have no idea how to update them so they come on the various Kodi support forums blaming Kodi for all the problems. Meanwhile the sellers have disappeared and are selling the boxes under a new name.
nd it leaves a rather bad reputation. Similar to Bittorrent.
"Recently an absolutely non-tech-savvy friend of mine explained to a bunch of friends how he was streaming pirated movies, TV etc. via Kodi. I was blown away that he even knew about XBMC / Kodi, the classic media center I've been using for more than a decade (though never with subpar, crappy streams)."
"Needless to say he only knew about it since it was advertised as enabling piracy. He most certainly didn't download it from official sources and will run into problems in no time."
"I just wanted to say that I was very surprised to see Kodi reach mainstream awareness and it's a little sad that this was enabled via the infamous piracy spotlight."
"Don't kid yourself.  The users of Kodi have always been using it to watch their own pirated media collections.  They just weren't using streaming services, so there was a higher barrier to entry.  Now that it truly is a one stop shop for pirated media access, it's reached the primetime."
"> Don't kid yourself. The users of Kodi have always been using it to watch their own pirated media collections."
"Yes, me included. I think that's an entirely different discussion, but let me just point out that I love to buy content that I own. I do it with music all the time. Buying about 5-10 lossless digital albums is a weekly habit for me.\nI can't do that with movies since content creators / publishers don't allow me to buy that kind of content in a digital, DRM-free format I truly own."
"- It has to be DRM-free as I want to play it with my media player of choice and possibly long after the service I bought it from may or may not be around any longer.\n- While I don't care for the physical medium and would prefer to play the movie in Kodi, it could be Bluray if it wasn't for the long delays between theatrical release, US Bluray release and the release in my country. I don't care for localization. I require the original audio track / language. I'm not content with the delay between US Bluray and local Bluray release while the movie is already available on torrent sites."
"Bottom line: I'd gladly pay for movies if it was as easy and consumer friendly as buying music."
"Same. I don't buy it, but I pay for both Spotify and Apple Music."
"But I will not get the same from Netflix. I have to get Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. just to get back to what I actually want. I am not saying Spotify has absolutely everything, but it is so close to everything I don't have to worry too much. I don't even pay for Apple music because they have different content, I only do that because it works better in my car and spotify works better with Echo."
"Having used Kodi for close to 15 years (from XBMP through XBMC), it's definitely taken some tinkering, and you still run into edge cases and occasional crashes."
However the Kodi team has made an amazing job simplifying installation on numerous platforms, to the point where the most advanced thing you need to know is how to use a USB stick and 7-zip.
If these people (box sellers) ship it with a remote control, and a self-contained Kodi distro (Ubuntu), I have no problem seeing anyone using it intuitively as plug & play.
"Maintaining is mostly an issue with your own library in my experience. If that part is outsourced to third party plugins there's not much to maintain. Though if that plugin breaks/is forked/whatever then you're boned."
"I really feel for the Kodi team though, getting blame for piracy, numerous support requests stemming from unaffiliated third party plugins, and all for an amazing open source product they've made for free."
"You'll be surprised... My uncle and auntie are using it now... they are into their 70's and don't know how to use any tech apart from a remote control."
"A cousin of mine, who's a dentist in his mid 40's and hmm lets say he lacks behind on technology, found a way to set it up and gave it to them."
hey use it and they don\'t even understand that its using the internet to stream pirated data... I told them that and they were like "no, he bought it for us from amazon, why they sell illegal stuff there, its free".
"So yes I have valid proof of 2 people that don't know how to Google - Google fully using it."
 very non-technical friend of mine bought one on eBay and said it was very easy to use. Just plugged it into the TV over HDMI and it worked great.
It gave access to just about every cable channel and every film and TV show. It cost \xc2\xa350 - his theory was that if he had to buy a new one every month, it was still cheaper and easier to use than the alternatives.
"Back in the 90's everyone knew a source for pirated analog satellite decoders and if it stopped working you went back to the guy you bought it from. Isn't this just the modern version of that?"
"There's a little shop near me that sells Kodi boxes. They used to build PCs when that was a thing, now they do laptop and phone repairs. \xc2\xa369 for the box including installation, \xc2\xa320 for updates. That's a bargain compared to \xc2\xa370/month for Sky. Most people have a geeky nephew who'll sort it out for a bit of pocket money."
here are vendors for these things in malls in Canada even. There are Kodi addons that make it super simple, just push a button and stream movies off file lockers kind of thing.
It\'s pretty much dead simple and "just works" - with the exception of what happens when the services they use dies. Then you\'re in trouble. The quality is also often abysmal.
"That's why I'd rather use the Usenet setup (Sonarr/CouchPotato/Sabnzbd/Plex/Emby) and pay $10/mo to a sketchy IPTV service, I know they at least try to maintain their streams and if you hunt around you can find decent quality."
"If it's anything like the bandit cable box market of the 90's, buying one means you go back to the source if it needs to be repaired/updated."
the interface is very easy to use, from what I understand these "fully loaded" ones alreaddy have the apps installed and configured, so it would probably be easier than a roku for most people. Then they just dont do any maintenance
"The interface is one of the worst I've ever seen. \nI "
"My Kodi install on my smart TV has one purpose: To play things out of a directory on my NAS. Yet I have it added roughly 7 different ways, and have no idea how or why things get cataloged. All I know is I'm too afraid to remove any of the sources because I'm not sure which one's being used."
"And I'm not sure I know how to remove a source, either."
"I struggled with Kodi on my jailbroken AppleTV2 and it never worked right. At least it does the basic job of playing media from my NAS, so I'm happy. No waiting for Plex to decide to index my content, no fuss, no muss. Open Kodi, play files from NAS."
>> the interface is very easy to use
"If they're selling Android Kodi boxes from China (which I suspect they are, since they're widely available, preconfigured and cheap), then I would disagree. These boxes have incredibly flaky UIs."
"As for Kodi itself, it's fairly usable, but I would say the process of adding non-public repos for shady add-ons might be a little overcomplicated for a non-enthusiast who just wants to watch a soccer stream."
Can someone comment on what is the business model of those who set up streaming servers for Kodi etc. ? Bandwidth is expensive , why would you pay for it just to give it away for free ?
"Kodi itself is just the new name for XBMC (XBox Media Center). It's an open source media centre project, and they are in no way affiliated with any of this."
"fully loaded kodi boxes" are just set top boxes pre-loaded with kodi and a number of plugin that make it convenient to access pirate streams or download content in a style reminiscent of popcorn time. Since These guys are basically just bundling Kodi and some plugins on cheap hardware, they make a quick buck selling that. The torrents and streams are just there anyway, so it\'s not a cost they need to concern themselves with.
he question was: who is hosting the streams, and how do they make money?
"I think there are sites that just focus on doing that for creating ad revenue. If I'm not mistaken, a lot of the Kodi plugins for sports scrape the /r/{insert-league/sport-here}streams subreddits for the stream links."
Mostly unrelated streaming websites which work on ads. Community members build addons to access videos from those sites directly on kodi.
"There's are many shady streaming sites that are designed to be accessed through a web browser where they serve up ads and malware.  There are also quite a few file locker services where people put streaming media, same idea.  Then there are aggregators that index all this content.  The Kodi plugins basically scrape both the aggregators and the file hosts and bypass all of their ads."
"The news article mentions Premier league and other TV networks . I am guessing that these kodi boxes are being used to consume live TV content or TV shows.  A day's worth of shows in high resoution could consume upwards of 4GB. Why would anyone seed that ?"
I guess you only need one person to do it, and then all of the consumer Kodi boxes will also be seeding.
Yes, it does. Most popular bit-torrent p2p streaming solution now is Acestream. You can check it yourself.
"However, I doubt that 'fully loaded' Kodi boxes uses it, most likely it use simple m3u streams harvested from internets."
"I didn't know acestream was p2p. I think I may have used it one or twice. Very cool."
"If they're hooked into a BitTorrent client, aren't they seeding as well?"

Kodi is free software built by volunteers to bring videos, music, games and photographs together in one easy-to-use application.
ome shops sell legal set-top boxes and TV sticks, often called Kodi boxes, preloaded with the software.
he developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content "freely available" on the internet."
o is this like Popcorn time, then? Did the sellers break laws? Did the developers break laws?
"Kodi's developers didn't, no. The way the streaming boxes work is they add a bunch of piracy streaming plugins to a Kodi installation. It's not easy for casual users to do this though. If you download Kodi today you can't just access that stuff. You need to enable access to unknown source plugins then find the plugins (and hope they aren't doing anything nefarious), download them and install them in Kodi. It's essentially the same as Android."
Kodi does have a lot of plugins to access a wide variety of free content (nearly 400 video content plugins alone). You can see what is available here: 
"It's an open source media centre application - used to be called XBMC. The illegal stuff are plugins for the software. I haven't used it since it was XBMC, quite a few years ago, but I imagine you could definitely plug things like Popcorn Time into it."
Copyright holders considering DRM to promote the purchase of their work rather than the piracy of their work should really be aware that there are a lot of people who will not consume your product if it\'s not free. The notion that you\'re protecting your work is not realistic. For many the options are to consume the product any way they can, or not consume the product. The thinking that DRM will ultimately make someone purchase something they never intended to purchase in the first place is unlikely. By having the pricing reflect this "lost" revenue (which was never lost, it was always assumed) you\'re only punishing the people who weren\'t going to pirate your product anyway. You\'re not punishing pirates. If you make a movie rental $1 instead of $4 you\'re much more likely to sell the product to interested people as well as the people who would have pirated the product if it were more expensive. Stop investing in DRM. You\'re wasting your time and the investment to defeat DRM will always be worthwhile to your competition.
"I know it's slightly off topic, but I can't help thinking that the Federation Against Copyright Theft should be going up against those big businesses that actually steal the copyrights themselves."
o like when one studio steals the copyrights from another, or from the content creator directly.
hey\'re not really fighting against that kind of "copyright theft."  They\'re just an industry front group, so they\'d never attack their own backers.
I know that, it is just the words that make up their acronym mean something different to me. So I find it highly amusing to have them be against copy right theft but be backed by the very people that are most likely to actually steal copyrights. Kind of like coal and oil company lobbyist using Green in the title.
s it has been said before. Piracy is a service problem. Yes, you can rent stuff via amazon but the prices are too high.
I will watch several hours of television and entertainment a night, if I did this via amazon I would end up paying well over $200 a month.
If they can scale that back to something reasonable like $75 a month, I am sure that I would be more willing to pay.
"IMO it is similar to pre-install a browser with bookmarks to pages listing, but not necessarily providing, such copyright infringing material. I'm not sure if this is really illegal - I guess it depends on the country you live in."
It is a little more complicated than that though. A computer or web browser is general purpose. These boxes are sold specifically for copyright violation or whatever you want to call it (pirating, theft, etc).
Maybe if Mozilla/Google offered a version of Firefox/Chrome that came pre-configured with links to a bunch of torrent sites and bundled in extensions to download torrents, unpack archives and play media it would be similar.
Kodi is also a general purpose media player in the first place. There are enough websites on the Internet that would conveniently offer you such content to click and stream (no need for torrent, unpack etc.)\nIn general Kodi does the same thing - it streams that content over your device (again no torrent, unpacking etc.)
t the end the only real difference is the advertising of that box - meaning if I would somewhat distribute a firefox browser with the proper links and call it the watch any media for free browser I would be in trouble.
Yup and that is why selling a generic Kodi box is fine. Loads of places sell them without issue.
he issue here is that these five people have taken a normal Kodi box, modified it and then 
he real issue here is how these people were advertising and selling the device. It raises interesting questions though - would they get into the same amount of trouble if they sold a generic Kodi box with instructions for the user to configure it in such a way? What if they sold it with just a link to a Google search that had such instructions? What if they provided a script you could download and it would do the configuration automatically for the user but what they sold was actually a generic (legal) Kodi box?
"That's possibly how it will be presented, but I'd argue you're wrong."
"It's similar to bit-torrent in that it has plenty of legal uses (torrents are great for downloading linux distros)."
"In the example you're responding to, the computer could easily be marketed in the same way as these boxes, and then there would be little distinction beyond ease-of-use."
> The boxes are specifically marketed for copyright violation, sure.
"Assuming these are the Android TV boxes from China, these boxes don't come with vanilla Kodi."
hey come with Android apps whose specific purpose is to get copyrighted content (like Showbox), and the pre-installed Kodi comes with a pile of add-ons that do the same.
On a vanilla system, a normal user would have to go get those apps and add-ons themselves.
he Android apps (apks) are easier to find/get than the add-ons for Kodi. You need to know the locations of the repos to get some of the shadier add-ons and that involves legwork that would likely be daunting for non-enthusiasts.
>> "The boxes are specifically marketed for copyright violation, sure. But Kodi is a general-purpose media player."
"They're not just marketed for it. They come setup so that you go to the TV shows section and see a list of every TV show and every episode that you can play with one click. So comparing to a computer marketed the same way doesn't make much sense. A more accurate comparison would be selling a laptop that is locked down to the Kodi software setup to stream any TV show or movie the user wants illegally. I'm 99% sure all of the features the fully-loaded boxes come with access to in the UI are illegal."
ight. I guess if I were going to tread in those waters, I would literally sell a "fully-loaded kodi box", like I would load every plugin available.
Presumably a great many of them are not related to illegal activities.
"Anyway, I've never thought that making it easy to commit a crime was a crime in and of itself. Selling lockpicks is maybe a similar example."
"I'm not familiar with all the details but the Pirate Bay trial seems analogous."
"I'm not so sure. It feels similar, but here's the difference, as I see it:"
PB provided direct tracker downloads and/or links to trackers that were illegal files.
hese guys are installing some software that is the equivalent of TPB. The software provides "links" (more or less) to illegal video streams, but providing those streams, or the data to find them, is not something these guys have done.
I think this would be more like some other examples in this thread, where maybe you provided a browser or extension that kept up-to-date torrent site bookmarks.
"Yes and that is why selling a Kodi box isn't the issue."
he issue is taking that general purpose Kodi box then making and marketing it as a way to "watch free Sky TV!" and such. The issue isn\'t that it is a Kodi box but that it is modified and sold with the primary (one could maybe argue sole) purpose of violating copyright.

s time goes by,\xc2\xa0 TiVo gets harder to love.\xc2\xa0The cable-box DVRs for which TiVo serves as an alternative are becoming more sophisticated, with modern interfaces, voice search, and built-in streaming apps. Forgoing cable entirely is also getting easier, thanks to a proliferation of streaming services and new over-the-air DVR solutions. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s consumer hardware business is getting squeezed from both directions.
he TiVo Bolt Vox is an attempt to push back. Like the existing TiVo Bolt, the Vox serves as either a DVR for cable subscribers or a way to record free over-the-air channels from an antenna. Its main addition is a new remote with voice search, and it also ships with a long-awaited software overhaul. (Existing TiVo Bolt and Roamio owners can upgrade to the new software for free, and buy the voice remote for $45.)
But while TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s recording capabilities are still second-to-none, and its integration with streaming services is still a clever idea, the Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s additions only paper over deficiencies in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app platform and hardware. Despite the new software and voice search, using a TiVo Bolt Vox still feels like stepping back into a bygone era.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has the same design as the old Bolt, with a rectangular enclosure that arches updward on one side. Around back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a coaxial input, HDMI output, optical audio output, 3.5mm audio jack, e-SATA storage port, and two USB ports. (The USB ports don\xe2\x80\x99t support external DVR storage, and the only e-SATA drive that works with TiVo sells at a huge markup.) A hatch underneath the Bolt Vox houses a CableCARD slot.
he TiVo Bolt Vox has every conceivable port you might need.
iVo is selling three versions of the Bolt Vox. The 500GB model and 1TB models both have four tuners and cost $200 and $300 respectively. The 3TB model has 6 tuners for $500, but it only works with cable, not over-the-air broadcasts.
In all cases, TiVo charges $15 per month or $150 per year for DVR service. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lifetime service option for $550, which is on top of the cost of hardware.
If you want to use TiVo as a whole-home DVR, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s Mini or Mini Vox satellite units, which costs $150 and $180 respectively. The latter comes with the same voice remote as the Bolt Vox, and it supports 4K video. The Tivo Bolt Vox can stream live and recorded TV to iOS and Android devices at no extra charge. (There\xe2\x80\x99s also a beta app for Fire TV devices, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been updated in two years and only works with recorded programs.)
One thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice with the TiVo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x94at least if it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting out in the open\xe2\x80\x94is that it\xe2\x80\x99s constantly whirring. Noise emanates from the unit whether it\xe2\x80\x99s recording or not, whether the TV is on or off, and strangely even when the TiVo itself is on standby. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a major nuisance, especially from 10 feet away, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of how unobtrusive fanless streaming boxes and sticks are by comparison.
One might say the same of the TiVo Bolt Vox remote, which remains a hefty tool loaded with buttons, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99ll seldom press. The main differences from the regular Bolt remote are the new voice search button (more on that later), a Netflix button, and a dedicated button for TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s existing ad-skipping feature. Cable subscribers will likely feel at home with the setup; but again, those who\xe2\x80\x99ve grown used to streaming players like Roku and Apple TV may recoil at the remote\xe2\x80\x99s chunkiness.
he Tivo Bolt Vox remote borrows more from cable boxes than modern streaming devices.
he Tivo Bolt Vox\xe2\x80\x99s biggest new feature is its software, previously codenamed \xe2\x80\x9cHydra\xe2\x80\x9d and now just known as the New User Interface. It\xe2\x80\x99s pre-loaded on the Bolt Vox, but existing TiVo owners have the option to upgrade as well.
iVo has given its UI some much-needed streamlining.
he new software strikes a more modern look, trading rounded rectangles and color gradients for sharp edges and solid colors. It\xe2\x80\x99s also more visual, often letting you scroll through thumbnail images instead of plain text.
More importantly, it provides a much-needed streamlining to the menu system. The main menu now has three content sections\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Shows\xe2\x80\x9d for recordings, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d for recommendations, and a launcher for third-party apps\xe2\x80\x94plus a search function and a settings menu. The What to Watch menu is especially useful, creating a unified TV guide out of various channels and streaming services. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a strip of quick recommendations at the bottom of the screen, based on what TiVo thinks you might like.
he \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d menu pulls upcoming programs, recordings, and streaming video into one handy guide.
Voice commands are helpful too, letting you jump around the menu system and search for titles, actors, and directors. The remote seldom failed to understand me, and search supports complex queries like \xe2\x80\x9c80\xe2\x80\x99s comedies\xe2\x80\x9d and follow-up questions like \xe2\x80\x9cJust the ones with Rick Moranis.\xe2\x80\x9d You can even filter the results to only show content from Netflix, Amazon, or Vudu. The only downsides are that search doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with all streaming services\xe2\x80\x94HBO Go is a major omission\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t search from inside a third-party app.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s voice search is accurate, and understands complex queries.
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s software still has some rough patches. Transitions and animations tend to be choppy compared to modern streaming boxes, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon menu concept\xe2\x80\x94in which rows of image thumbnails appear as you scroll through a column of menu text\xe2\x80\x94can be disorienting compared to fully image-driven apps like Netflix. There\xe2\x80\x99s also no apparent way to browse shows by genre while filtering out results from streaming services. And most annoyingly of all, TiVo always reverts to playing live TV when it\xe2\x80\x99s left alone in a menu for too long. It really ought to revert to standby mode instead.
Beyond those gripes, I imagine some TiVo enthusiasts will be dissatisfied with design changes in general, and with some particular things like the replacement of the 
It\xe2\x80\x99s all the more tragic, then, that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s streaming app support is still lacking.
lthough TiVo offers most of the basic streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any streaming channel bundles, which cord-cutters might want to supplement over-the-air channels. The platform has MLB T V, but not NBA League Pass or NHL TV. CBS News lacks the live anchored coverage that\xe2\x80\x99s offered on other platforms, and neat new streaming apps like Pluto TV and Hoopla are also absent. Aside from HBO Go, pretty much every TV Everywhere app is missing from TiVO as well. A fresh coat of paint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s app catalog is stagnant.
You know an app platform has problems when Flixfling and Ameba are near the top of the list.
he TiVo Bolt Vot is still a great DVR at its core. It allows users to get granular with their recording preferences, for instance by keeping only a certain number of recent episodes, avoiding recordings in standard definition, and customizing start and stop buffer times. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to weed out scheduling conflicts through a dedicated menu, and with four tuners in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s base models, conflicts should be rare to begin with. TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s OnePass feature, which lets you view recorded and streaming episodes of a show from a single view, remains a nice touch as well.
But without a vibrant app scene, the TiVo Bolt Vox still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as an all-in-one entertainment box for the streaming age. Cord-cutters in search of consolidation should instead look to 
a decent option for a single television
, provided you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind switching inputs when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stream.
he TiVo Bolt Vox will mainly appeal to diehard cable subscribers who might not mind the investment in TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s hardware and services. But as more people give up cable TV in favor of antenna channels and streaming services, the squeeze on TiVo seems unlikely to let up.

\n      TiVo Bolt review: Watching TV faster\n    
kip commercials with one click, and speed up the rest of the show, too
Back in 1999, when I first reviewed the original TiVo DVR, I griped that \xe2\x80\x9cTiVo has no commercial-skipping button\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that its press literature denounced such a feature on grounds that, while it "may appeal to the pirate in all of us, it just doesn\'t make good business sense."
It\xe2\x80\x99s taken 16 years, but TiVo has finally changed its mind. Its latest model, the radically redesigned Bolt, which goes on sale this week for a base price of $300, finally lets you ditch all the ads in a blink. By simply pressing a button once, you can skip an entire block of commercials in many recorded programs, a feature called SkipMode. No more fast-forwarding and hoping you land on the right spot, or repeatedly hitting a 30-second advance button.
nd the company\xe2\x80\x99s PR has changed as well. \xe2\x80\x9cSkipMode transports you past these annoying interruptions and back to your recorded show in an instant,\xe2\x80\x9d TiVo now boasts.
, a new weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and  Re/code by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Re/code.
Of course, TiVo is a hybrid box that\xe2\x80\x99s for people who want both cable and streaming shows, at a time when more people are shunning cable. But it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a long time before cable is truly abandoned, and lots of people will be happy that the company is making it easier to watch.
In my tests, over the past week, SkipMode invariably made all the commercials disappear and returned me exactly to where programming resumed. The box even prompted me when it was time to skip the ads. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work on every recorded show.
nd that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way the Bolt can save you time when watching TV.
he latest TiVo also boasts another new feature, called QuickMode. It speeds up any recorded show by 30 percent, without making the dialogue sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered by chipmunks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timesaver, to be sure \xe2\x80\x94 perfect for, say, golf or baseball or talk shows. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every show this way. In my tests, QuickMode worked as promised, though shows looked more or less watchable at faster speeds, depending on their nature. For instance, I noticed no problems with "The Big Bang Theory," where the characters talk fast anyway; but found I missed some nuances when watching "Sherlock".
till, you can save a lot of time with these QuickMode and SkipMode \xe2\x80\x94 even more if you combine them, which you can for those recorded shows compatible with both.
he Bolt is an odd-looking, white box with an angled top and bottom, which replaces the current low-end, and most popular, model of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s current Roamio line, the Roamio-S. (The other Roamio models will remain on the market.) It\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller than the Roamios, and the tapered top surface makes it much harder to stack things on top of it.
Like the Roamio-S, the Bolt has four tuners, which means you can record four shows at once. It also has the same 500 Gigabytes of storage as the Roamio-S, though you can double that for another $100.
But it improves on the older model by supporting 4K video, gigabit Ethernet, the faster AC version of Wi-Fi, and streaming of shows to mobile devices and computers on the same network. (It lacks the costlier Roamio\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-home streaming feature, but the company says it plans to add that next year.)
Unlike some TiVos I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested over the years, I found setting up the Bolt to be a breeze, including the transfer of the cable card from my personal, older TiVo.
iVo has not only drastically overhauled the appearance of its product, it has taken steps to hide the monthly $15 fee it charges over and above what your cable service costs. The company has long justified this fee on grounds that cable companies also charge for boxes and DVR service, but it has always seemed excessive to me for what should be an all-inclusive tech device.
o make the price more palatable, TiVo has trimmed it some and bundled the first-year service fee with the hardware to arrive at a $300 base price, with no additional service charge for the first year. After the first year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be billed $149 a year for the service. By comparison, the older model it\xe2\x80\x99s replacing sold for $200 and had a $15 monthly fee, or $180 a year.
o what are the limitations of the new commercial-skipping feature?
Well, for one thing it only works on recorded shows, even though after a day I was dying to use it on live TV as well. For another, it only works with shows where the start and end points of the commercial blocks have been tagged, a process TiVo says is done by actual people. So far, only 20 channels are included, but they include popular ones like the four major broadcast networks, USA, TNT and Comedy Central.
It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work with sports or local programming \xe2\x80\x94 even when they are recorded. And it only works for other shows between 4pm and midnight, because TiVo figures that\xe2\x80\x99s when most viewing occurs, and it wanted to put some limits on its manual tagging process to start with. Also, it can take a few minutes for a show to become commercial-skippable and gain a tag in its listing that says "Skip."
"One of the most important features of the Bolt isn't new, but it\xe2\x80\x99s improved: it combines old-fashioned cable TV with popular online streaming services in one box. That means you can go from cable to Netflix without the common hassle of changing your TV\xe2\x80\x99s input to switch from your cable box to, say, your Apple TV or Roku."
For years now, TiVo has been quietly (and clumsily) integrating services like Netflix and YouTube and Amazon Prime into its boxes, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t boasted much about it.
ow, with the Bolt, TiVo is ready to proclaim itself the One Box To Rule Them All. Or, in the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, a "Unified Entertainment System".
ot only does the new Bolt call itself the only TV box you\xe2\x80\x99ll need, it actually has new features to make that claim stronger. It switches between cable and streaming video more smoothly than past TiVos, and it has a faster version of its previous integrated search, which brings up results from both cable and internet video and lets you watch or record from the source of your choice.
In fact, the whole product is faster and smoother, due to a faster processor and triple the memory, when compared to the base Roamio. Also, the user interface is now almost entirely HD, except for two subsections of the settings menu. And the platform for apps like Netflix is now HTML5 only. The company junked Flash.
nd, when you set up a season-long recording (called a OnePass), the Bolt fetches episodes from every available source, including streaming services and my cable company\xe2\x80\x99s On Demand service. Even if a show is on hiatus, older episodes available on these services are offered up.
In my tests, Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube looked as good as they do on Apple TV and Roku. And, if I had a 4K TV, Netflix and YouTube could have looked even better, since the Bolt supports their 4K programming.
Well, the Bolt only offers a handful of the many, many online streaming services available from Roku or even the more-limited Apple TV: Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, Yahoo, and popular music services including Pandora and Spotify. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Hulu, which is on the Roamio, but TiVo says it expects Hulu to return once its app has been reconfigured for HTML5.
lso, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bug in the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix app which can cause the service to freeze. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent and will be fixed soon, but I ran into it and had to reboot the unit.
While TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s search is reasonably fast and cross-platform, it still requires you to peck out characters on an onscreen keyboard. Meanwhile, Amazon, Roku, Apple and even Comcast have gone to searching by voice. TiVo says it\xe2\x80\x99s actively exploring doing the same.
I have owned a TiVo for years, and appreciate it. Despite the odd look of the Bolt, I found its new features attractive and reliable.
But the fusion of linear cable and streaming internet video in one box is a big deal, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s been around \xe2\x80\x94 quietly \xe2\x80\x94 for awhile. TiVo has finally got this right.
ure, a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s on cable is already available in streaming form on many devices. And, eventually, all of it will be. But that will take awhile. Meanwhile, unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the cord, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want some mix of cable and streaming services. And this product pulls that off, while making old-fashioned TV much better, with commercial skipping and the occasional speed-viewing.
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Bolt should make non-cable users suddenly buy cable. But, if you already have it, this is a good solution.

In a perfect world, everyone would have TiVo. Gone would be the hours of frustration spent while you railed at your cable provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR that had managed, 
, because the late-Sunday Packer\xe2\x80\x99s game went into overtime and, God-forbid CBS ever just 
, and you knew this would happen; but the only options your dumb box gave you were \xe2\x80\x9cRecord\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCancel\xe2\x80\x9d so you had to just trust that it would 
"\xc2\xa0know that it needed to timeshift things when the schedule got all f'(ootball)ed-up."

But the hardware is secondary to the amazing software package you get with the TiVo Bolt. After living with it for a few weeks, I would find it practically impossible to go back to anything but the Bolt. For those of you on an older TiVo box, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice right away that the interface has been cleaned up considerably, with a Live TV window in the corner and suggested shows running along the top. The menus are responsive and all settings are much more accessible than in previous versions of the OS. What\xe2\x80\x99s particularly noteworthy is OnePass. The outdated Season Pass feature is gone. I loved it because it let me catch every episode of a show, no matter when or where it aired. But inevitably I would miss an ep and be stuck rifling through Netflix or sifting through VuDu or Amazon. OnePass takes those two paradigms, recording live television and streaming video, and mashes them together. Now, I can see a listing of all the seasons and episodes of a OnePass show, along with\xc2\xa0where I can get them from. VuDu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime are currently supported on the Bolt (Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry! HuluPlus is coming too!). This was an absolute life saver when I managed to delete the only\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0show that daughter was interested in watching.
QuickMode is an essential feature on Sunday at my house. My son is a consummate football geek. He wants to listen to every second of commentary and pore over every replay. Me? I just want them to snap the ball already. Usually this meant I would fast forward through all the cruft between plays, right up to the snap, allowing me to watch the game in a fraction of the time. After all, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two kids and the schedule to match, fitting in three hours of football is an unheard of luxury. QuickMode lets us both get what we want \xe2\x80\x93 it speeds up the playback to 30% of normal, which is just enough to considerably compress the time it takes to watch a game; but still leave all the commentators intelligible \xc2\xa0(well, as intelligible as they ever were\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s not a 
kipMode is the Holy Grail feature for the Bolt. Having used TiVo for the past decade, I have a deep-seated dislike\xc2\xa0of commercials. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how being able to fast forward past them practically whenever you watch a show considerably lessens your tolerance. In fact both of my children, when confronted with live television for the first time, were gobsmacked when I explained to them that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just fast forward past the commercials to get back to their shows. The Roamio introduced a dedicated 30-second skip button, which made jumping past commercial breaks a matter of a couple of presses (and some guessing). The Bolt retains that button; but adds the ability to skip past the commercials entirely with a single press. SkipMode is\xc2\xa0the closest thing you can get to a streaming video experience for recorded television and it\xe2\x80\x99s glorious. It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten so I practically refuse to watch anything live anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather wait the hour or so for SkipMode to be enabled for the show. It\xe2\x80\x99s available on nearly every Prime Time show and its commercial-free nirvana. My only wish is that this feature could be enabled across the entire TiVo line (and on\xc2\xa0
\xc2\xa0show)\xc2\xa0so that I could use it on my Mini.
he elephant in the room is that the Bolt requires you to sign up for a service package (or buy a lifetime subscription for the unit). However, it does comes with a free year of service \xe2\x80\x93 so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to decide if the greatest DVR ever is worth the $150 a year (They do offer a monthly plan, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not offered up front and it\xe2\x80\x99s $15 a month, which is kind of a \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d after a year of free service). The nice thing is that you can recoup some\xc2\xa0of those costs by turning in your cable-provider\xe2\x80\x99s DVR and renting\xc2\xa0a CableCard from them instead. In the end, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a far superior experience for less cash per month.
, depending on the capacity you choose. My advice? Spring for the more expensive 1TB model, get a TiVo Mini for your other TVs, and let the Bolt be the media streaming device for the whole house.\xc2\xa0Speaking of, there are huge streaming plans in the works for the Bolt. Currently, you can stream your recorded shows in-house to your phones and tablets. But the addition of out-of-home streaming is coming, which means you can get anything your Bolt can access\xc2\xa0
I was a big fan of the software refresh that came out for the Roamio last year and figured the Roamio would be the last TiVo I bought for a long time. When the Bolt was first announced, I was skeptical that TiVo could do much more to improve upon their model. I have happily been proven wrong. If you watch TV, you need a Bolt. it\xe2\x80\x99s that simple.

Were you in any way paid for this favorable review?
iVo provided me with a Bolt, as I noted in the review. But just because a company offers an item to review does not guarantee them a favorable article. The opinions expressed in the review are my own. 
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a TiVo subscriber for over 10 years. I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of their products.
uto refresh on a page that users can leave comments?  Wow, talk about bad design  My long comment went poof on the refresh
Hey! Sorry about that \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a per-article setting that I usually catch and turn off (since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been caught by it too and it\xe2\x80\x99s ULTRA annoying). I\xe2\x80\x99ve made sure that the auto-refresh is off now. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!
I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of lousy cable/Fioptics DVRs. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking at buying a Bolt since it came out. But I want aa remote Mini with it, and realized that it requires a hardwire network connection, NOT wireless. That\xe2\x80\x99s not possible for me.
eading further, you can use coax to set up a network \xe2\x80\x93 MoCA. The Bolt can create such a network, but the Bolt must be hardwired into the router \xe2\x80\x93 also not possible for me. You can buy a $50 MoCA to define network\xe2\x80\xa6
o it\xe2\x80\x99s not simple, unfortunately, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made the investment yet.
I can appreciate that. Setting up the MoCA network over coax was the part that gave me the most trouble. Of course, that was due as much to my poor networking skills as anything else.

o Amazon 4K UHD streaming at launch\r
o out of home streaming at launch
12.03.15)
, and rumors are swirling that a 4K Roku\xc2\xa0is days away from announcement. It seems clear that 4K UHD support is the next big thing for streaming set-top boxes (unless, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99re Apple TV). Now you can add TiVo to that list of supporters with the introduction of the new TiVo Bolt Unified Entertainment System.
ressed in a Storm Trooper-White chassis that is both sleeker and more compact than TiVo DVRs of the past, the Bolt aims to redefine what people think of when they think TiVo.
kipMode is the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial).
ptly described by the company as a \xe2\x80\x9cUnified Entertainment System\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a DVR, the 4-tuner Bolt carries on the tradition 
he bottom line: With a boatload of fun new features, 4K UHD streaming apps, and the best content-searching system available, the TiVo Bolt is in prime position to take over as your home entertainment hub.
When it comes to set-top design, big black boxes are out and significantly smaller black boxes are in. Even cable companies stuck in the last century have managed to shrink down the size of their cable boxes. Anyway, TiVo needed a new look, and the Bolt supplies this in a bold way. The new chassis is bright white, the on-board buttons are gone, and the lights have been integrated. The box is also much smaller than TiVo units of the past \xe2\x80\x93 33 percent smaller than the Roamio and 65 percent smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro, according to TiVo. And then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s strange arch in the middle \xe2\x80\x93 this is likely more of a utility feature than an aesthetic choice, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that later.
urprisingly, TiVo still uses a mechanical hard drive here (likely to keep costs down). The new Bolt is available in a 500GB model for $300 and a 1,000GB (that\xe2\x80\x99s 1 TB to everyone else) goes for $400. One year of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s service (normally $150 per year) is included with each. \t\t\t

In the box with the\xc2\xa0Bolt is a white 12-volt DC power cable, a white TiVo remote, and a black 6-foot HDMI cable, along with a setup and product features guide.
ot much is new in terms of connectivity for the TiVo Bolt. The most notable change is the inclusion of an HDMI 2.0a compliant output for the latest 4K UHD support. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also find two USB 2.0 ports and an eSATA port for external storage.
iVo needed a new look, and the Bolt supplies this in a bold way.
n Ethernet port provides a hard-lined connection to the Internet, which we recommend for 4K UHD content streaming, though a built-in Wi-Fi adapter is available (which won\xe2\x80\x99t work with the TiVo mini, by the way). For those with neither of the aforementioned network options, the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial cable connector does support MoCA for Internet over a cable connection \xe2\x80\x94 separate MoCA adapter required. Inside the Bolt is a 4-tuner DVR capable of recording \xe2\x80\xa6 you guessed it, four shows at a time.
iVo also placed the box\xe2\x80\x99s CableCARD slot underneath the unit, behind a small panel.
On the feature front, however, plenty is new. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the breakdown
kipMode \xe2\x80\x93 Perhaps the Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting new feature (and likely to be its most controversial), SkipMode takes TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s ad-avoidance capabilities to the next level. Rather than force users to press a skip button several times during commercial breaks, SkipMode removes them automatically at the press of a single button. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the catch, though: SkipMode works only with certain primetime and late night TV shows, and only after they have been completely recorded \xe2\x80\x93 it won\xe2\x80\x99t work if you start watching while the recording is in progress. Still, this new feature gives users an extremely powerful tool for cruising through their favorite programs, requiring minimal effort to avoid long-running ads along the way.
QuikMode \xe2\x80\x93 This feature allows the user to get through long-running programs a little bit faster. Similar to the speeding up of syndicated content that certain networks employ in order to cram in more ads, QuickMode speeds up the show by 30 percent (1.3 times the standard play rate) but without raising the pitch of the sound. For example, you could cruise through a 3-hour sports broadcast in just 2 hours and 6 minutes, but the game announcers won\xe2\x80\x99t sound like chipmunks \xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99ll just sound like auctioneers.
4K UHD Apps \xe2\x80\x93 Though we\xe2\x80\x99re a little disappointed that 4K UHD app support is a bit scant at launch, the Bolt will support 4K UHD streams from Netflix and YouTube right away. Support for Amazon, Vudu, and other 4K UHD streaming content is expected (and needed) in the near future.
ven more apps \xe2\x80\x93 The Bolt also supports Plex, Pandora, Spotify, and Rdio, connecting you with content you have on your home network, as well as tunes from popular streaming music services.
upport for Apple TV and Fire TV \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo would probably prefer that you invest in one of its TiVo Mini boxes to share stored content with other televisions in the house, but with support for Apple Airplay and a new TiVo Android app available for Fire TV, you can use the streamers you might already have to access all of your recordings. The TiVo Mini is still the best tool for getting the most out of the Bolt, however, with support for SkipMode, QuickMode, and access to streaming apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and more.
emote finder \xe2\x80\x93 Press a button on the back of the Bolt and a little song will play from your remote, enabling you to find it among the couch cushions, in the fridge, or wherever else you are prone to misplacing it.
iVo offers the best search feature available on the market. Simply plug the title of what you want to watch into the OneSearch box, and TiVo will show you where you can watch it and how much, if anything, it will cost you. When you search for a movie or TV show, TiVo polls your DVR recordings, live TV, VOD (in select markets), and apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant, and Vudu (depending on whether you have a subscription) to show you where you can watch and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a fee involved. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to avoid paying twice for a flick you already paid to have access to.
\xc2\xa0lets you watch live and stored content anywhere you have an Internet connection. And if you know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be away from the Internet for a long period of time, you can download your stored recordings for offline viewing any time you want. The app also works as a remote control and allows users to manage recordings.
Current TiVo owners will be happy to know the Bolt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t present any unpleasant surprises. The interface looks and feels exactly as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no learning curve. Aside from having to manage some settings in order to get your OnePass recordings going and secure access to your streaming service accounts (entering usernames and passwords), getting the Bolt up and running is a piece of cake.
hose new to TiVo will wonder how they ever put up with their cable company\xe2\x80\x99s terrible interface for so long. Unnecessarily long strings of menu options are a thing of the past with most common commands just a few clicks away. And for a really easy search experience, TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s mobile app cuts a lot of time out of data entry.
For this review, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on evaluating the new features the Bolt brings to the table. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with QuickSkip which was everything we had hoped it would be. Remarkably, we were able to skip entire segments of The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon so that we could get to the parts we really wanted to see. The skip is nearly instantaneous, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not certain whether you\xe2\x80\x99re watching a show that is QuickSkip enabled, the Bolt will remind you. Our only complaint (and likely an unreasonable one) is that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use the feature on every show, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just us being greedy. The feature covers most of the primetime favorites, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be plenty for most.
QuickMode is a great idea, but we think it will take some getting used to for most folks. Returning to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, the comedian and host often speaks quickly enough that speeding him up makes some of what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying unintelligible. On top of that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain comedy to the sped-up, quick-clipped movement you see when watching standard TV programming. However, we imagine this feature will be great for golf and other slow-paced sports, and an absolute God-send for any long lectures one might have to sit through. Now if only we could QuickMode life when we wanted to!
treaming 4K UHD media went exactly as expected. We think TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s superior services and search abilities make using the Bolt appealing as an alternative to using the 4K UHD apps embedded in Smart TVs. The Bolt also packs plenty of horsepower, quickly loading apps and keeping buffering to a minimum when Internet speeds were sufficient.
Our complaints are few. Chief among them, however, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no Amazon Prime Instant 4K UHD support right out of the box. You get Amazon Prime, sure, just no 4K UHD video, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a disappointment.
We\xe2\x80\x99re also sad that out-of-home streaming isn\xe2\x80\x99t available at launch, though TiVO promises it will be offered in a future firmware update.
he Bolt isn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to handle streaming High Dynamic Range (HDR) content yet, either. The company told Digital Trends that HDR is too much a moving target, with three different formats competing. That may be true, but Amazon has picked its pony, so we can only hope TiVo is prepared to react when Amazon brings this new element of 4K UHD video to consumers.
We should note that the Bolt runs a little warm. Conveniently, however, the box\xe2\x80\x99s exhaust fan is located underneath the chassis at the apex of the angle, maximizing exhaust and cooling potential. The only potential issue we see with the shape, however, is that it is destined to the top component on any stack, as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be placing anything on top of it.
Other issues are just nitpicks. For instance: The included Plex is quartered in the Music and Photos menu, even though it very much plays video.

While Amazon, Apple, Roku, and Google primarily have the attention of so-called cord-cutters and cord-nevers (those who have given up cable or never had it) the TiVo Bolt appeals to everyone \xe2\x80\x93 and especially cable subscribers \xe2\x80\x93 with a long list of useful features you simply won\xe2\x80\x99t find anywhere else. In a world where the digital content we want to watch is smeared across a jagged landscape, the TiVo Bolt does an outstanding job of putting everything you want to watch, and listen to, in one place. Without a doubt, the Bolt is TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s most outstanding product to date.

\n                      September 30, 2016 \n                      by Jim Rossman, The Dallas Morning News\n                      \n

"In a call with the Bolt's product manager, I asked why the case was not level. I said it wouldn't play nice in my home theater cabinet because it would be difficult to stack other components on top of it."

Continue reading to understand how different DVRs work and which features are most important to have.
\n    Important to know: most internet streaming services don\xe2\x80\x99t allow video to be stored on a DVR.  
he market is flush with DVRs right now. Some are sold through places like Amazon, and some are available from television subscription package providers.
If you subscribe to a cable or satellite TV package, chances are the service provider has its own DVR. You could choose to use that DVR, confident in the knowledge that it is compatible with your service.
hird-party DVRs are also available. These DVRs aren\xe2\x80\x99t tied to any subscription television provider like DirecTV or Comcast. You can think of them as free agents; they work with a variety of programming options. All of the DVRs on our shortlist fall into this \xe2\x80\x9cthird party\xe2\x80\x9d category.
If you find your DVR is running out of space, you may be able to start recording your shows at a lower resolution. This will save storage space versus recording in HD resolution.
hird-party DVRs are purchased by consumers outright, whereas cable/satellite DVRs may be \xe2\x80\x9crented\xe2\x80\x9d to the consumer for a monthly fee.
ome third-party DVRs have a monthly subscription fee.
 cable or satellite TV provider almost certainly will charge you a monthly subscription to use its DVR.
In some cases, however, the cable/satellite TV provider may give you the DVR for \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d in exchange for your subscription to their service.
ot surprisingly, cable/satellite TV providers would rather you use their DVR than a third-party DVR. So, they don\xe2\x80\x99t provide compatibility with every third-party DVR maker.
long those same lines, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a DISH satellite subscriber, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to take your Hopper DVR to your new Charter cable subscription.
In short, if you want to use a third-party DVR with a subscription package, check for compatibility before buying.
When watching live TV, the DVR automatically queues the video, keeping it in memory. You then can pause and rewind. But once you change the channel, most DVRs clear the memory queue.
ewer DVRs have quite a few valuable features that make them easier to use than ever before. If you love your TV, you will want to take advantage of these features.
VRs have a variety of ports on the back of the unit. But the easiest method of connecting a DVR to a TV is via an HDMI cable. You can connect other devices to the DVR, like an 
, through a second HDMI port or a USB port. Many DVRs have an input port for an Ethernet cable to allow you to connect it to the Internet. Some allow WiFi connectivity, too.
\n    The best way to connect a DVR to your HDTV is through an HDMI cable.  
Most DVRs offer the same types of video control options. If the video was previously recorded and stored on the DVR\xe2\x80\x99s hard drive, you can pause, fast forward, and rewind the video.
With live TV, you can pause and rewind. Fast forwarding is not available with live TV, unless you rewound or paused the live TV video earlier and have not yet caught up to current time.
If you choose a third-party DVR, make sure the remote control works with the TV as well as the DVR. It\xe2\x80\x99s just easier to keep track of one remote control.
he storage mechanism of a DVR is a hard drive, a technology similar to what\xe2\x80\x99s used on a computer. This makes sense, as digital video is basically a digital binary file, just like any computer file. The storage size of the hard drive inside a DVR varies from model to model.
Few DVR manufacturers openly advertise the size of the hard drive in their products. Rather, the size of the hard drive is listed as the number of hours of programming you can store.
\n        With some newer DVRs, you can add extra storage space by attaching an external hard drive or an old DVR to a USB port on the newer DVR.      
 DVR\xe2\x80\x99s interface includes the menus by which you\xe2\x80\x99ll pick recording options and watch your stored programs. It also usually includes a programming guide. These interfaces vary from maker to maker, so shop around to find one you like.
ome interfaces are confusing to set up and have a clunky design, while others are easy to use. The programming guide should offer a list of channels and information about each show. You should be able to set up recording directly from the programming guide.
\n    Owners of the Channel Master DVR say they love its snappy, easy-to-use interface.  
ome DVRs allow you to record one, two, or even more other programs while watching TV. This is a fabulous feature that helps ensure you never miss a show. You may need a cable/satellite TV subscription package to make it work, though. The 
VRs offer multiple recording options. You should be able to record a particular show each time it airs, either first-run episodes or all episodes. You can record the show you\xe2\x80\x99re currently watching with one button press. And you can set up a single show to record through the programming guide.
You should also be able to tell the DVR to extend the recording time beyond the program\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled end time. This is a handy feature for sports programming, just in case the game goes into overtime.
Gone are the days when you must be at home to catch your favorite shows. With a DVR, you could capture an entire season of \xe2\x80\x9coff hours\xe2\x80\x9d programming that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise be able to see.
ome DVRs allow you to access video streaming services directly through the DVR menus. These models contain apps that you can pick from, just like 
treaming service apps are commonly found on third-party DVRs. This is one of the strengths of the 
When comparing different DVR models\xe2\x80\x99 storage capacity, be sure that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at storage hours in full 1080p HD resolution for each model.

) is the next generation of resolution at 3840x2160 pixels.
\n    One of the major differences between a DVR and a VCR is the fact that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to manually set up recording of each TV episode on a DVR. For example, with TiVo, you can set up a \xe2\x80\x9cseason pass\xe2\x80\x9d that records all episodes of your favorite show.  
If your DVR is connected to the internet, some DVR makers will allow you to use an app to connect to it and watch your stored content from a remote location.
\r\n\tCompared to a traditional cable/satellite TV programming package, a skinny bundle is a \xe2\x80\x9creduced\xe2\x80\x9d package that costs less and also offers fewer channels. You may be able to order a skinny bundle from a cable or satellite provider. But third-party companies often offer skinny bundles via internet streaming.
\r\n\tStreaming video is the process of playing a video from the internet. When streaming through an internet connection, you download and play the video at the same time. Most DVRs cannot store streaming programming. Whether you can store streaming video on a DVR depends on the type of streaming video service you have and type of DVR you\xe2\x80\x99re using.
\n    Important to know: it is rare to be able to save video from a skinny bundle streaming service to a DVR\xe2\x80\x99s hard drive.  
VR prices vary quite a bit. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pay from 
2-Tuner
If you go with a DVR from a cable or satellite provider, you may receive the DVR for \xe2\x80\x9cfree.\xe2\x80\x9d But you probably will have to pay monthly fees to use the DVR, to receive HD capabilities, and/or to use a programming guide. Watch out for these hidden fees from cable or satellite providers.
\n        If you want to record HD programming, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to make sure your DVR supports this type of resolution. Some low-end and older DVRs cannot record in HD.      
Q. How do I know how much space I have left to record on my DVR?
he DVR\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer should list the total number of hours of programming the DVR can store in its marketing materials. So look on the web for this information, then apply the percentage of free space remaining to the total storage number to determine how many hours of storage remain.
Q. How do I only record new episodes of a TV show?
Q.\xc2\xa0Can I store downloaded internet video on the DVR?
\xc2\xa0Newer DVRs should be able to connect to the internet via an Ethernet cable or through WiFi. If your DVR is able to make an internet connection, you may be able to download video and store it. Whether you can store this downloaded video depends on the type of service from which you\xe2\x80\x99re downloading it and the type of DVR you\xe2\x80\x99re using.
Q.\xc2\xa0Can I use a DVR without a cable or satellite subscription?
\xc2\xa0There are standalone DVRs that work with over the air (OTA) programming. For example, the 
Q.\xc2\xa0What exactly can I do with live TV when using a DVR?
\xc2\xa0Most DVRs offer the same basic functions with live video. You can pause live TV without actually saving it to the DVR\xe2\x80\x99s hard drive. Each DVR will be able to hold the live TV feed paused in a memory queue for a specific amount of time, usually between 30 and 90 minutes. You can rewind live TV to the point where the memory queue started recording. And you may be able to save live TV to the hard drive, usually just by pressing a button on the remote.

iVo embraces voice controls in new Bolt Vox, Mini Vox, and Vox Remote
he rumored voice-control remote with Netflix button is now a reality.
iVo announced today an update to its line of set-top boxes that makes voice a main feature. The new Bolt Vox and Mini Vox devices include all the features of the original TiVo Bolt and TiVo Mini. But now, the devices also have native voice functionality. That means the set-top boxes, using the new TiVo Vox Remote, can now search for, record, and play content across live TV, DVR, on-demand, and streaming services using voice commands.
From TV trailblazer to IP afterthought: TiVo bought for $1.1 billion
"Aside from a color change from white to black and the addition of voice functionality, the Bolt Vox and Mini Vox are exactly the same as the original devices. The TiVo Bolt has four integrated tuners for watching or recording between 75 and 150 hours of HD content (depending on storage capacity). The TiVo Bolt+, which came out at the end of last year, is now the most specced-out version of the TiVo Bolt Vox. It features six tuners and 3TB of storage space, which is good for up to 450 hours of content. However, that model doesn't include an antenna, so it can only be used with digital cable systems."
he Mini Vox pairs with an existing TiVo box and allows users to get the TiVo experience on other TVs in the house. By pairing a TiVo Mini Vox to a Bolt Vox device, you can use TiVo features like SkipMode\xc2\xa0and QuickMode, stream and watch live TV, access DVR content when connected via Ethernet or MoCA home network, and more. The new Mini Vox also supports 
, a feature that the original did not have.
\n                      New TiVo Bolt Vox with Vox Remote.                    
\n                      It comes in 500GB, 1TB, and 3TB storage options.                    
\n                      Ports on the back of the Bolt Vox.                    
\n                      It appears to be similar in size to a Roku or Apple TV device.                    
\n                      Ports on the back of the Mini Vox.                    
\n                      New Vox Remote with dedicated voice and Netflix buttons.                    
\n                      Press the blue voice button to command TiVo to find shows, switch channels, and more.                    
"Voice commands are initiated through the new Vox Remote, which ships with all Bolt Vox and Mini Vox devices, and it can be purchased separately as well. There's a blue-colored voice button on the remote that, when pressed, prompts the Bolt Vox or Mini Vox to listen to you. "
"This kind of multi-layered voice control sounds convenient because it doesn't force you to know exactly what you want immediately. Instead, it allows you to naturally build on previous requests. Most voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant can't do this\xe2\x80\x94each question you ask is its own contained command, and building off of a previous request is often impossible. It makes sense for TiVo to make this kind of questioning easier because we tend to narrow down our TV and movie search options as we think of criterion that fits our mood."

iVo\xe2\x80\x99s new Bolt offers 4K streaming and commercial skipping
In addition to search, voice commands also let you hop among channels more easily (you can simply say the name of a channel and the new TiVo devices will turn to it immediately). Voice commands also let you find a show in your DVR vault, as well as see all the purchase options for TV shows and movies. The redesigned TiVo interface makes everything more visual with show thumbnails and artwork, and the new SmartBar carousel\xc2\xa0feature suggests titles for you based on your watch history and the time of day. That means the new software will learn what you like to watch in the morning versus at night and suggest similar content at the right time.
"SmartBar will likely come in handy in a multi-person household. TiVo doesn't currently support multiple user profiles on one device, so narrowing down titles by time of day may help suggest content for specific people in your home. If your children watch their favorite shows in the afternoon after school, you'll only see related children's content recommended during that time. Children's shows won't be recommended to you late at night after the kids have gone to bed."
"In addition to showing content from different streaming services like Netflix (there's even a dedicated Netflix button on the Vox Remote), the new TiVo interface will show you movies and TV episodes you can purchase and your buying options. Connecting services like Amazon Prime, Vudu, and others will allow users to quickly make purchases through TiVo by selecting the best buying option after deciding on a movie or show to watch."
he new TiVo Bolt Vox will be available later this month starting at $199. The Mini Vox will start at $179, and the Vox Remote for Vox devices will cost $39. Those who already have a TiVo Roamio device will be able to use voice features through a firmware update and by purchasing\xc2\xa0a model of the Vox Remote specifically for those devices, which costs $45.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fan of TiVo since I first purchased a Series 2 in 2003.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a fan of TiVo since I first purchased a Series 2 in 2003. That was back in the day when you got lifetime service for $250. I even had a book (printed on paper) that taught me how to hack it. The 30-second skip was revolutionary at the time, and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t install a button to do it without their advertisers pushing back, so it was disguised as a remote hack. Fast forward 17 years and two more TiVo models and I got a Bolt.
he Bolt is a new direction for TiVo. Expanding from prior models that only had DVR capabilities, this is the first fully integrated entertainment unit that encompasses streaming features.
he company generously offered to replace my Series 2 TiVo for only $100, mostly so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to support my ancient technology any more. My old TiVo was still running and worked fine, albeit slow. Last month I got a 150 hour, 
4-tuner
iVo has always had a knack for making things simple. The UI has been groundbreaking from the start. The main Home button on the remote and one screen that accessed everything. TiVo applied its uniquely streamlined approach to entertainment to current technology.\nThe problem is that today\xe2\x80\x99s market won\xe2\x80\x99t support a freelance DVR. Cable companies want you to use their set top box with a monthly service charge. You can patchwork a solution with a smart TV, but the clunky interface makes it a challenge.\nThis is where TiVo hits the sweet spot. The Bolt seamlessly integrates all of the disparate inputs like live TV, recorded episodes, streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a Harmony remote that not only controls all your devices but integrates all of your viewing and listening options in a streamlined, easy to use interface. It does everything your current technology can do, but better. 
he design of the box seems to be inspired by Apple\xe2\x80\x99s iconic 7-second, slow release iPhone box. It\xe2\x80\x99s less than two pounds, white with no visible external buttons or lights. The remote is a smaller version of the same ergonomic design I was expecting. The unexpected bent shape echoes the slight bend the company added to the refreshed logo.
lthough I liked the shape, it was not appreciated by all members of my household. One didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the lack of symmetry, the other questioned the decision to make it so that nothing else could be stacked. My conclusion was that it\xe2\x80\x99s so much smaller than previous models, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find a spot for it. 
nd so begins the dark side of my experience. The TiVo customer service rep had told me that the Bolt would require a cable card, so I had ordered it from Time Warner Cable ahead of time. Thus began my multitude of phone calls and the descent into frustration. 
WC sent me a cable card and a tuning adaptor in a huge box. According to the enclosed paperwork from TWC, the cable card was compatible with TiVo devices, so I mailed the tuning adaptor back. I got distracted by life and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get around to setting up the Bolt for two months. In the meantime, the encryption code on the card changed, so it would no longer work. After a quick trip to the TWC office to get an updated cable card (and another tuning adaptor), I inserted the card and booted up the device and connected to my wireless. 
etup from there was simple. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved it for so long, but I was so pleased to hear that familiar bloop, bloop on keystrokes. Until I realized I was only receiving the non-encrypted channels. A few more phone calls to TWC resulted in adding the tuning adaptor to the setup. So my sleek TiVo got a clunky, awkward little brother.
he status lights are visible through the outer casing. They seemed a bit bright at first, but perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t accustomed to seeing the device where it was positioned. It took me a day or two to decide to turn off the lights as an option. The device cooling fan is mounted on the bottom, exchanging air under the curve. It\xe2\x80\x99s noticeable in a quiet room as a low hum, but not bothersome.\n
"The cross-service Search stands out as a premium feature. It combines all of the content from streaming services and your TV schedule together. When you search for a show, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a list of episodes on TV, plus results from Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu Plus (if they\xe2\x80\x99re running it). If they're only available for purchase, it will tell you so and the prices across services.\nThe new skip functionality is the real deal. With a single button press, skip to the beginning of a program that you padded with a few extra minutes skip the entire commercial break. No more 30-second jumps.\nA new feature for me is the What to Watch Now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a thumbnail list of the 20 most popular shows airing live in the current time slot. You can also filter it by sports, movies, and kids. "
iVo\xe2\x80\x99s monthly service fees raise the total cost of ownership. Even if you paid \xe2\x80\x9cfull price\xe2\x80\x9d of $199 for the box, the Best-In-Class user interface and ease of use still make it a bargain compared to the cable company\xe2\x80\x99s awkward DVR.
iVo vs. Cable DVR over 24 months
I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with the purchase, setup, operation and performance of the 
. In my opinion, TiVo has always had a uniquely intuitive user interface which has now expanded to become the first full-service entertainment unit that I\xe2\x80\x99ve used.\nThe Bolt seamlessly integrates every stream, recording, OTA and cable options into a single interface with a search function that works across all options. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a set top box that actually delivers on providing shows, movies, music, and entertainment apps in a streamlined, easy to use interface. It does everything your current technology can do, but better.

"I drafted a review for my TiVo Bolt.  I bought one days after they became available and have been very satisfied though I definitely have some feedback.  I thought I'd post it here and on the TiVo forums as well on some common retail sites.  Hopefully some of my constructive criticism is taken to heart by both sides to make Plex on TiVo as well as the new TiVo Bolt as great as their potential is!   Let me know what you think, thanks!"
"I had been researching a new replacement for my aging Roku2XS which has served my household well for the past few years.  The new Apple TV was not an option with no 4k support, nor was the new FireTV which seems to lack HDMI-CEC support.  Google's recent announcements did not include any updated hardware for Android TV and Roku's recent announcement for the Roku4, while a platform I know and love, also did not seem to include HDMI-CEC support.  I'm done with weird, little remotes all over the house so an included remote that could control TV volume, input, and power was a MUST.  Harmony Remotes have not worked as well as I had hoped in the past, so a unified remote was a primary function.  Basically this left me with 2 options: the new TiVo Bolt or the Nvidia Shield.  Both have most of the features I am looking for; both natively support Plex (my other absolute MUST, no side-loading please!), both had means to control everything I needed with one remote, both have 4k support, and both offer unique features that were quite appealing (gaming on the Shield and live OTA or cable TV on the Bolt)."
"The primary key to this puzzle (besides one remote to rule them all) is Plex integration.  My family uses Plex as our primary media source.  All the streaming channels I'm looking for, all the local music across my family's collections, and all the media (and home movies) that we have spent countless hours converting from discs over the years, make Plex the perfect personal streaming service.  No Unified Entertainment System solution could be complete for my household without it!  That being said the Bolt and the Shield both offer access to the latest Plex apps."
"Comparing on price I found that the Bolt was only marginally more expensive outright than the Shield, especially once you factor in a proper remote (and not a game pad) for the Shield.  There is a monthly service fee for the Bolt but that doesn't kick in until after the first year, and while more expensive than ever now, there is still a lifetime subscription option for TiVo Devices if you don't care to be nickel and dime'd every month/year.  Factor in the extra subscription costs after the first year and the TiVo is no longer comparable on price, but what you get in return is (it was in the past we'll see how I feel in a year) worth EVERY PENNY!  The WONDERFUL remote alone may well be worth the service fee for me!"
In the past I was a die hard TiVo fanatic.  I started using TiVo in the late nineties and turned many people on to their service.  I still recommend TiVo to anyone looking for a DVR solution, if it is an option for them.  To be able return to the platform has always been a dream, and now with true Plex integration it has become a reality.
"As a prior Aereo subscriber (RIP Aereo, you were ahead of your time and too good for this world) I love that I can receive OTA broadcasts through the TiVo Bolt.  Sports and local news are once again available in my home!  I have not seen commercials for many years and I am happy to report that I still (mostly) don't have to.  The new SkipMode is absolutely a game changer.  Sure there are others out there that can do the same/similar thing, but nothing with all of the other services and features the Bolt has, and nothing that will likely be around in the future (if the cable companies continue to have their way).  It does have some limitations, but when I can't use it, I LOVE that the fast forwarding  still works as expected.  I'm still an expert at landing right at the start of the show again after fast forwarding at full throttle!    I didn't realize how much I missed the bloop,bloop,bloop of TiVo's Time Shifting technology!"
"Something I was not expecting with OTA recording was recording multiple channels at the same time.  This is an expected feature when using a cable card, but for multiple tuners on OTA, I would expect a need for multiple antennas.  I guess I'm not up to speed on what's possible with digital OTA antennas as I have certainly seen multiple simultaneous recordings with only one HD antenna!  I'm not sure if all four tuners can record at once with an OTA HD antenna but I was not expecting more that one for OTA in the first place.  Kudos, Tivo!"
"Jumping back to my mention of sports, I'm not a huge sports fan.  Now, I can stand to watch sporting events, local news, awards shows and the like, thanks to QuickMode!  Watching those types of shows using QuickMode is near perfect.  Normal scripted television and movies don't always lend themselves to using QuickMode, as I usually prefer to enjoy those shows at normal speed, but the feature simply works.  One thing I notice, though, with QuickMode is that during dialog (while perfectly pitch corrected) sometimes the pauses between sentences or in a conversation between characters are so tight that it feels a little odd when you hear it.  Luckily no one will force you to use QuickMode so you can choose when it suits you!"
"The remote is still the BEST remote on the planet.  The button presses feel just right, not too hard, not too squishy.  For new users, or for people coming from other streaming OTT boxes I could see how it might be intimidating or confusing, but I honestly can't imagine it taking too long to get used to.  That perfect 'dog-bone' shape and the button layout makes for far and away the best remote control experience on the market!  From using a Roku for so long I have a terrible habit of hitting the guide button instead of the select button, kicking me out of what ever menu I was in, but I don't expect that to last much longer, though it is a pain sometimes if you're in a deep menu.  Also the improved hardware makes for a VERY snappy experience.  Button presses are instant and I never feel like the system is being taxed or the remote is lagging behind my inputs!  Such a smooth experience!  The included remote finder feature is also very welcome"
"The OnePass feature is new to me.  When I previously had TiVo it was SeasonPass and it was not yet integrated with streaming services.  The OnePass feature takes SeasonPass and one-ups it.  Some things I notice about OnePass though are as follows:  I'm not sure how TiVo is getting the listings for streaming services but sometimes their info is out of date.  Some episodes that OnePass tells me are available through streaming services are actually not and others that are listed as free or included with my streaming services turn out to be for pay or rent.  This doesn't happen often but I honestly expect better from TiVo.  We'll see how that pans out.  A huge negative for me with OnePass right now is it is not integrated with Plex.  Episodes and movies that I have on Plex are not accounted for in OnePass.  Being able to incorporate my Plex database is such a huge feature that I don't understand why it hasn't been done here with OnePass or ANYWHERE with the search functions always touted with other OTT streaming boxes!  TiVo, this is a must have with future updates!  I'm also pestering the Plex developers for this function!"
here are a few negatives to the TiVo Bolt.  Some (like OnePass issues with Plex and other streaming services, the price, and a very minor side-effect of QuickMode) have already been mentioned.  Some others are
Currently Plex is treated as a second class citizen, tucked away in the Music and Photos section or deep in the My Shows menu.  This needs to be right, front and center with Netflix, Amazon and others.  My main reason for returning to TiVo is integrated Plex.  I\xe2\x80\x99m very hopeful that this will be remedied in future updates and am banking on TiVo not being a(n expensive) detour of an OTT streaming box for me after this first year!
"The box gets warm.  Not hot, but warm.  Warm enough for the odd, though likable, shape and an inability to trust it tucked away in a cabinet.  This isn't a big deal, I just prefer an uncluttered look to my console table."
"The UI and the menus are quite busy.  This also isn't a big deal, but comparing to Roku, Plex, xBox or other 10ft UI's meant to be accessed from the couch, the TiVo UI is certainly the most complicated.  That complication offers some unique features, like suggestions on the 'home' screen and continued playback of OTA/cable/recorded (not streaming) content while in the menus.  Regardless, it's a busy UI."
"There are a few notable, yet missing, streaming content providers.  HBO Go/Now, ShowTime Anytime, Hulu, Bloomberg, PBS, and others are simply not available at this time.  This seems to be something that will be added in the future but I haven't seen definitive confirmation on which providers or when, if ever.  I already miss Bloomberg and HBO Go quite a bit.  Having a better assortment of the streaming 'channels' people want and use is a key aspect of a device such as this and something TiVo should not take lightly.  I expect more in that regard."
"External streaming is still missing.  This is a big feature that is still lacking.  In-home streaming works great through the TiVo app.  Out-of-home streaming has been promised by TiVo for early 2016.  Still, it's not here day 1."
"Speaking of the TiVo app, it is great, but for some reason it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to figure out how to 'thumbs up' 'thumbs down' a show from the app.  Otherwise it is quite good, although, it seems to suffer from the same sort of cluttered UI as the Bolt itself.   I did have issues with the app not realizing I was on my home network and not letting me stream locally at first.  A restart of my iPad eventually resolved that."
"There is a lot of competition in the current market for OTT streaming boxes.  I think TiVo has one of, if not, the best.  While the new TiVo Bolt is definitely a recommended buy (even with it's high price), I'm forced to give 4 out of 5 stars.  There are simply too many things missing to give a 'perfect' score.  Were all the negatives addressed in this review available Day 1 I can't imagine a better Unified Entertainment System.  The TiVo Bolt it one of the first devices that can really 'do it all'.  All that's needed now is for TiVo to step up and flesh out the features that are missing.  Microsoft is looming large in the rear view with the xBox One and its rumored upcoming DVR capabilities.  I would hate to see TiVo get passed by in the near future when the technology needed is already in the Bolt just missing a little polish."
"PMS on 2011 MBP; PHT on 6 PC clients of varying OS's; Plex clients on 1 xBox360, 1 Roku, 1 Kindle Fire, 5 iPhones and 1 iPad; incredibly satisfied!"
sk me about Plex on the new TiVo Bolt! \xc2\xa0Not right now though...
his is FIXED in the Roamio! It is right there with the other Video providers now.
"Currently Plex is treated as a second class citizen, tucked away in the Music and Photos section or deep in the My Shows menu.

I\xe2\x80\x99m very hopeful that this will be remedied in future updates and am banking on TiVo not being a(n expensive) detour of an OTT streaming box for me after this first year!"

hanks for the tip, I checked before I tried to update and sure enough there it is!  I checked a OnePass I have to see if Plex episodes are listed but unfortunately they are not yet.  That will be the killer integration feature.  I will update my review before posting elsewhere.

sk me about Plex on the new TiVo Bolt! \xc2\xa0Not right now though...
iVo search does not pull movies from Plex on the Roamio. That would be nice.
I have been a Tivo user since the product was introduced.  I currently have a Tivo Premiere that provides a Plex client, but it is so slooowwww that it is unusable.  The same goes for the Netflix client.
I am interested in the Tivo Bolt, primarily to get a good experience with Plex and Netflix.  If anyone has some experience with the Plex client performance, I would like to know about it.
econdly, the Bolt could go a long way to reducing my remote clutter.  If I can get a fast and flexible Plex client, then that eliminates my RasPlex box.  If Netflix works great on the Bolt, I can eliminate a DVD/BluRay box that I now use for Netlfix access.  That could mean NO MORE INPUT SWITCHING!!!
nother question about the Bolt: the new remote is an RF device, so how do I control my IR TV power  from the Tivo remote?
Plex is the main reason I upgraded to the Bolt.  Its a great combination.  Netflix worked ok on the Roamio but is much quicker on the Bolt.  Loads in just a couple seconds and most items I have in my shows that link directly to netflix mean I do not have to navigate the netflix app at all.  Just goes straight to playing the stream.
he Tivo remote is IR and RF and should control your tv power and volume fine.
ice review. Premiere user here, 3, but appreciate the Bolt review.

Why I broke up with TiVo after so many years
\n            Published 1:13 p.m. ET Jan. 27, 2017 | 
Updated 5:01 p.m. ET Jan. 27, 2017
W YORK\xe2\x80\x94I broke up with TiVo this week.
It had been a longstanding romance that began late in the 20th Century. Then and now the highest praise I can bestow upon any product that I review is to buy that product once a review is published. And TiVo was one of the first products on which I chose to spend my own money.
iVo redefined the very way we watched television. It may not seem remarkable nowadays, but to those of us old enough to remember, the idea that you could pause and rewind \xe2\x80\x9clive TV\xe2\x80\x9d was pure magic.
But it was more than TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s role (along with ReplayTV) as a DVR pioneer that made it special. It was the way in which TiVo found stuff you wanted to watch, without you having to hunt down those programs. You\xe2\x80\x99d create a \xe2\x80\x9cseason pass\xe2\x80\x9d to a favorite show and let TiVo figure out when and what channel it was on and when to record it. Or you\xe2\x80\x99d punch \xe2\x80\x9cthumbs up\xe2\x80\x9d on the remote to clue TiVo in your preferences and have the service find shows you didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily know you wanted to watch. Or you\xe2\x80\x99d create \xe2\x80\x9cwish list\xe2\x80\x9d searches around a favorite actor or theme.
"TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s interface and guide was far friendlier than anything offered up by the cable company; through the years I'd been a customer of Time Warner, Cablevision and eventually Verizon Fios."
ll that said, TiVo\xc2\xa0no longer fit my situation. And it\xc2\xa0was with a great deal of sadness that I finally broke things off.
Last update coming for first TiVo DVRs
My last TiVo box\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d had a few through the years\xe2\x80\x94was a TiVo Premiere circa 2010 in my bedroom that had started acting up weeks ago and finally seemed to fail for good.
ure, I could replace Premiere with one of TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s fancy new Bolt boxes, but at $199 on up it made no sense given my set-up at home.
hese days, the main TV in my family room is connected to a Verizon\xc2\xa0FIOS Quantum DVR with plenty of storage and the ability to record six shows at once. Two other TVs are connected to smaller boxes that piggyback off the Quantum. That lets me watch the shows I\xe2\x80\x99d record in my family room on other TVs in my kitchen or basement, but not on what had been the TiVo-connected TV in the bedroom.
ven at that, beyond live sports and some news programs, I don\xe2\x80\x99t use the DVR to record much regular TV anymore. Like many viewers, I catch up on Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime and more by streaming\xe2\x80\x94using some combination of the Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast and Roku devices connected to my various televisions.
iVo didn\xe2\x80\x99t make economic sense either. Though I owned the Premiere outright, I was still paying TiVo $13.86 a month for service, plus another $4.99 a month to Verizon for a \xe2\x80\x9ccable card\xe2\x80\x9d inside the TiVo.
ll that of course was on top for the bundle I already pay Verizon for Fios each month, not only for TV, but for speedy broadband Internet and phone service. And yes, I still pay a small ransom for TV channels that I rarely watch, but that\xe2\x80\x99s on me and that\xe2\x80\x99s another story.
When I called TiVo to finally cancel this week, the rep dutifully asked me about 
, a nice option for some, just not me under the circumstances.
o sorry, TiVo it\xe2\x80\x99s not you it\xe2\x80\x99s me. I wish you well but just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on with the relationship. I went to Verizon and got another small Fios box for the bedroom TV, which adds $10 to my monthly Verizon tab. But after removing the TiVo and cable card fees, I still come out ahead.
I\xe2\x80\x99ll going to miss TiVo--the Fios interface is nowhere near as pretty or simple, and yes, breaking up is hard to do. Even when it\xe2\x80\x99s time.

VR maker TiVo today officially confirmed the launch of its new DVR, the TiVo BOLT VOX, and its smaller counterpart, the TiVo Mini Vox, 
. As had been reported, the biggest change is that these are the first TiVo DVRs to include a voice remote control, which allows users to search across live TV, DVR, video-on-demand and online streaming services just by speaking.
hese voice searches will also return personalized recommendations based on users\xe2\x80\x99 viewing habits, the company says.
dditionally, the voice remote goes a step further than some rivals\xe2\x80\x99 products, as it lets TiVo owners refine their queries on the fly.
"For example, you could say \xe2\x80\x9cshow me the movies with Tom Cruise,\xe2\x80\x9d then refine the query by saying \xe2\x80\x9conly the comedies,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe one where he says \xe2\x80\x98show me the money,'\xe2\x80\x9d explains TiVo."
What\xe2\x80\x99s more is that some current TiVo owners won\xe2\x80\x99t have to buy a new DVR to gain voice control features. The TiVo VOX Remote will be sold separately for $39.99, allowing existing BOLT, Roamio, and first-gen TiVo Mini customers to upgrade to voice control. The remote will be available in both black and white, so it can match the DVR customers already have. (The new BOLT VOX and Mini VOX come in black.)
he remote has been redesigned a bit from previous versions, as we noted yesterday. It now has a big blue voice button near the top, and overall, a more organized layout, plus a dedicated commercial skipping button and one for Netflix.
he BOLT VOX DVR will join the BOLT family of DVRs \xe2\x80\x93 TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s newer devices, aimed at helping users bridge the world between online services and traditional TV.
Like the original BOLT, select BOLT VOX models let viewers watch and record from either digital cable or over-the-air TV via a digital antenna, and search for programs across TV, video-on-demand and online streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and others.
he devices also support 4K Ultra HD which can be expanded to other rooms in the home with the addition of the TiVo Mini VOX.
lso as reported, the BOLT VOX will come in three sizes: a 500GB model (for up to 75 HD hours of storage space) and a 1TB model (150 HD hours), each with 4 tuners; and a 3TB model with 6 tuners which can record up to 450 HD hours. However, the latter model only supports recording from digital cable, not over-the-air. The devices start at $199.99, then go to $299 and $499 for the 1TB and 3TB, respectively; the Mini is $179.99.
he DVRs will ship will TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s new user experience, as well, which focuses on personalized recommendations and more visual elements, like poster art, actor and director bios, and team sports logos, to help users find what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for more quickly.
It also introduces a new QuickView feature that allows viewers to see shows playing on different tuners, favorite channels, a one-line channel guide, and TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s SmartBar \xe2\x80\x93 a new feature that displays predictions of shows based on users\xe2\x80\x99 past viewing behavior.
Like prior products, the DVRs will also let you skip the commercials with a touch of a button; speed watch shows at faster-than-normal speed via QuickMode; and watch across web and mobile devices in and out of the home, using TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s apps.
he new VOX products will go on sale at the end of the month, October 29, 2017, through tivo.com, Amazon, and in Best Buy retail stores.

Busy user interface and cluttered\xc2\xa0remote with a lot of buttons equates to a\xc2\xa0higher learning curve\xc2\xa0for new users
he most dramatic thing about the BOLT, at first glance, is the updated hardware design. Instead of a standard black box as TiVo has offered in the past, the new player is white, with a somewhat odd curve to it that initially takes some getting used to. Gone, too, are the hardware buttons in favor of integrated lights which makes the player feel more modern than the cable company DVRs it\xc2\xa0competes with.
he design itself is not only an aesthetic choice \xe2\x80\x93 the company says the gentle curve that lifts part of the player up also helps with heat dissipation. That\xe2\x80\x99s useful given the hardware\xe2\x80\x99s upgraded internals, which include a CPU that\xe2\x80\x99s three and half times as fast as the older Roamio model and three times the memory.
hese upgrades don\xe2\x80\x99t just make the TiVo BOLT perform better, but also aid with the newly added support for 4K video as well as the player\xe2\x80\x99s now built-in transcoding functionality \xe2\x80\x93 another improvement over the Roamio-S. \xc2\xa0The new BOLT will replace that device\xc2\xa0TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s entry-level DVR. Like the Roamio-S, the TiVo BOLT will also come with a 500 GB hard drive, though a 1 TB drive option will be available, too.
he other Roamio models, including the Plus (the 6-tuner, 1 TB Roamio model) and Pro (the 6-tuner, 3 TB model) won\xe2\x80\x99t immediately disappear, however. The Plus will remain in the market for a while and will \xe2\x80\x9ceventually\xe2\x80\x9d be replaced by BOLT. But the Pro, by nature of its larger capacity that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have a BOLT counterpart, will stick\xc2\xa0around for the time being.
Of course, although TiVo wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t confirm this, it seems likely that the Pro will also be\xc2\xa0phased out further down the road, as having a somewhat fractured product lineup could cause consumer confusion.
he BOLT device itself is smaller than earlier Roamio models \xe2\x80\x93 33 percent smaller than the Roamio and 65 percent smaller than the Roamio Plus and Pro. It includes support for both over-the-top streaming services, over-the-air recordings from antennas, and support for recording from cable TV. That makes it a decent option for both cord cutters and cable subscribers alike, assuming they\xe2\x80\x99re in the market for an all-in-one device like the TiVo.
On the back (and bottom) of the unit are a variety of inputs, including a CableCARD slot, Coax port, optical audio out, audio L/R (analog) port, an HDMI 2.0 slot (4K, 1080p, 24/60), Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, external storage port (eSATA) and power adapter port.
Inside, TiVo has stuck with spinning disk drives, to keep the cost down, the commonly says.
he TiVo remote has also had a bit of an upgrade. While it still feels cluttered with buttons like the remotes that often come with cable companies\xe2\x80\x99 DVRs, it now has a white design and buttons for new features like \xe2\x80\x9cSkipMode,\xe2\x80\x9d a\xc2\xa0commercial skipping feature that\xe2\x80\x99s activated by pressing the green \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d button, and \xe2\x80\x9cQuickMode,\xe2\x80\x9d the sped-up playback which is engaged by pressing the \xe2\x80\x9cPlay\xe2\x80\x9d button followed by the \xe2\x80\x9cSelect\xe2\x80\x9d button.
 handy feature is a \xe2\x80\x9clost remote\xe2\x80\x9d finding function that lets you press a button on the back of the TiVo itself in order to locate a missing remote control by way of an audio sound. And the remote offers RF technology to eliminate the need of pointing it directly at the TiVo unit in order for it to work.
he remote doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include voice support like Apple TV and Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Fire TV now do, but the BOLT itself is shipping with Bluetooth that\xe2\x80\x99s not yet turned on. That hints at a future remote hardware upgrade that could introduce a voice option.
he TiVo BOLT software, meanwhile, has also been refreshed. For those familiar with TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s look-and-feel, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much of a radical upgrade but more of an iterative one. There are some different colors used for certain on-screen navigational elements, flatter icons that complement the more modern design of the new unit, and channel logos now appear in\xc2\xa0the guide, for example.
What\xe2\x80\x99s more notable about the BOLT\xe2\x80\x99s software is its support for 4K, including in Netflix and YouTube apps, faster application launch times, and the\xc2\xa0new QuickMode and SkipMode features.
In addition, thanks to the more powerful hardware, apps on the TiVo BOLT can\xc2\xa0launch and resume a lot faster than before. For example, apps on Roamio would sometimes take around 10 to 15 seconds at startup, but now they take 5 to 7 seconds on BOLT. Plus, the BOLT is the only TiVo player that actually suspends the app in memory to allow for faster resumes.
iVo continues to focus on its larger strategy of allowing viewers to find, subscribe and watch content across a variety of sources, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s DVR recordings, programs on streaming services like Amazon and Netflix, or videos on YouTube. (Unfortunately, Hulu is absent from the collection of apps while TiVo waits for the company to transition to HTML5 from Flash.)
BOLT also still offers TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOnePass\xe2\x80\x9d technology that lets you instantly subscribe to shows, no matter where all those episodes are\xc2\xa0located. It\xe2\x80\x99s even improving this experience for new users with a \xe2\x80\x9cOnePass QuickSelect\xe2\x80\x9d feature that will point new subscribers via their welcome email to a page of popular shows they can subscribe to with a click.
s noted above, the other big additions for BOLT are the QuickMode and SkipMode features. The former was actually suggested three years ago by a TiVo engineer but never made it to production. Essentially, it\xe2\x80\x99s an option that\xe2\x80\x99s best used to speed up content like news or sports where you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get information, but not necessarily looking for the traditional, lean-back TV watching experience.
Instead, QuickMode lets you watch 30 percent faster, with pitch-corrected audio.
) is a brand of digital video recorders (DVRs).  Tivo devices provides users with the ability to save television programs for later viewing ("time shifting"), an electronic television programming schedule, and recording options based on that schedule.
With SkipMode, on the other hand, TiVo is actually tagging content in a way that allows users\xc2\xa0to push a button once to move to the next part of the program without having to view\xc2\xa0commercials. This feature is live on 20 popular channels, but currently only for primetime programming (4 PM to midnight, including repeats and late-night talk shows.) Using SkipMode doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with the option to use other playback functions like fast forward or rewind.
kipMode will be a BOLT-only feature, but QuickMode will roll out to other Roamio models as a software update later this year.
he BOLT\xe2\x80\x99s integrated content streaming \xe2\x80\x93 meaning its ability to stream to computers, phones and tablets \xe2\x80\x93 is limited at launch. Initially, users will only be able to view one stream in the home until November 2015 when support for two streams is added. Web streaming and in-home downloads work at launch as well, but out of home downloads and streaming won\xe2\x80\x99t ship until 2016 (the latter will only offer\xc2\xa0one stream, and arrives\xc2\xa0in the first half of next year).
he final part of the TiVo BOLT upgrade is the updated mobile app. First available on iOS in early November, with Android to follow, the new app is focused on offering users a more personalized experience. Instead of configuring user profiles, like on Netflix, customizations are per device and now include the ability for users to track their hobbies and interests in addition to genres and an expanded list of collections.
o get started, users will select from a list of hobbies and interests though an onboarding flow resembling that of Flipboard. This process then creates custom YouTube channels based on those\xc2\xa0picks. For example, if you\xe2\x80\x99re really into \xe2\x80\x9ccamping\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canimals,\xe2\x80\x9d you can add these sections to your \xe2\x80\x9cWhat to Watch\xe2\x80\x9d section.
Users can also now hide pre-configured feeds (like \xe2\x80\x9csports\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ckids\xe2\x80\x9d) if they don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that sort of content.
nd the app introduces expanded social sharing functions that go beyond Facebook and Twitter to include email and other methods. When a friend clicks a shared link, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the TiVo portal where they can choose to record the show (if they\xe2\x80\x99re a TiVo user) or be directed to the content itself (e.g. a list of episodes on the TV channel\xe2\x80\x99s own website).

Perhaps the most dramatic change to TiVo BOLT is the company\xe2\x80\x99s implicit acknowledgement that its current business model could be an issue going forward as more TV viewers\xc2\xa0cut the cord and turn to low-cost streaming services as their source for TV and movie entertainment.
While TiVo has focused on expanding the cable TV customer\xe2\x80\x99s experience, 
. And TiVo\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0subscription-based model can be hard to stomach for those who are looking for cost savings by signing up for cheaper services like the under-$10-per-month options from Netflix or Hulu, for example.
With the BOLT, TiVo isn\xe2\x80\x99t going so far as to ditch subscriptions, but is instead is deferring them in a\xc2\xa0way \xe2\x80\x93 a move that the company likely hopes will hook new users\xc2\xa0so they\xe2\x80\x99ll be willing to pay the fees when the time comes.
he BOLT will cost $299.99 for the 500 GB version or $399.99 for the 1000 GB version. That\xe2\x80\x99s pricier upfront than the $199.99 Roamio, which requires a subscription fee of\xc2\xa0$14.99 per month, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because the first year of service is bundled in. After year one, customers can choose to pay the monthly fee or buy an annual subscription for $149.99.

iVo, of course, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly admit that the TV market\xe2\x80\x99s shift is potentially bad for its business, but the new product and pricing does indicate the company understands it\xe2\x80\x99s not\xc2\xa0enough to just be an upgraded DVR for the cable TV viewer. It has to find a way to appeal to those who want multi-platform viewing and over-the-air DVR functions, too.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe do a significant amount\xc2\xa0of business with the cable TV providers so we\xe2\x80\x99re not encouraging people to drop their cable subscription, but the reality is the market is a lot more dynamic than even a few years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d admits\xc2\xa0Jim Denney, VP of product marketing at TiVo.
\xe2\x80\x9cBOLT should have a strong appeal to [cord cutters]\xe2\x80\xa6you get a full DVR, all the\xc2\xa0OTA DVR functionality, and all the OTT applications that round out your content experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re building it for people who have decided they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have pay TV, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a flexible platform \xe2\x80\x93 it can satisfy both contingencies.\xe2\x80\x9d

Wonderful! There are no limits to our TV viewing now. DVR has 6 tuners and 3 terabytes of storage. Can record so many shows and watch when we desire. Not tied to the tv schedule.
eviewer Rating 5 out of 5 stars 
Bought the 1 TB bolt shortly before this one came out and was always wishing I had more space and at least one more tuner. When I saw the plus model come out I had to get it. You will not be disappointed.
eviewer Rating 1 out of 5 stars 
"The bolt+ has a major issue with its HDMI. It won't always display signal sent from the tv. In order to get it working you need to unpliug and plug in again the HDMI cable pretty much every time you sit down to watch live tv or a recorded show. I even replaced the HDMI cable but it didn't solver anything. Customer Support at TiVo won't acknowledge the problem and just asks you to reboot the box. Once rebooted it works once and then they hang up on you claiming you are fixed.\r\nI did a little research and saw others had the same issue.\r\nIt may work fine with your television. Personally, its too much money for me to roll the dice had I known."

"This is an amazing DVR. Other TIVO DVR's are excellent, but this one is incredible. Six tuners, 3 terabytes of hard disk space, amazing abilities to fast forward with reasonable voice, or even faster (about 3X) with captions, other fast forward options significantly better than DVR's from Comcast or Dish which I have used. It is able to skip commercials with a single press of a button. Its search function which covers all the streaming services plus Comcast is second to none. I no longer need a bunch of remotes controls (e.g. ROKU, Amazon, etc.) and the device is already 4K ready. And the tech support is great! Totally recommended."
eviewer Rating 4 out of 5 stars 
I love this machine and I gave it 4 stars only because like the traditional cable box it doesn\'t display the time of day and it doesn\'t have the RF TV Out. The RF TV Out is important to me because I have a DVD recorder and I haven\'t figured out how to record tv programs to the recorder.\r\nI bought this box because despite the fact that I selected "Keep Until I Delete" Verizon Fios took it upon itself to delete programs when I ran out of space.
eviewer Rating 5 out of 5 stars 
"We love this DVR! I've had several TiVo boxes over the years and this is by far the best . Skip mode is awesome, tons of storage and the remote is very responsive. Spend the extra money on the 3TB of storage, you won't regret it"

"The TiVo unit was a great buy along with the TiVo minis. We couldn't be happier with the set up."
eviewer Rating 3 out of 5 stars 
"Even though this is the high end Tivo Bolt with 6 tuners, it doesn't seem to properly utilize all 6 at once. Even with no apparent programming overlap it keeps showing conflicts and won't record on all 6 tuners at the same time. Also, the error messages for recording conflicts are very confusing and of no help in figuring out how to resolve.\r\nAlso, level of personal customization is sadly lacking, and in some cases just doesn't work, like channel list removal of stations you have no interest in. I uncheck them in the list which is supposed to make them not show up, but they still do.\r\nGeneral performance is slow also. I get a lot of pauses and spinning wheels when there should be no issues, such as not while using on-demand, etc."

Hands down the best DVR on the planet. Onepass and the Tivo iOS app are terrific, Guide is awesome, Skipmode is the best thing since sliced bread. Why only a two star rating? Because this box fails as a 4K streaming device. The Bolt differentiates itself from previous versions with the ability to stream 4K content. It works for Netflix and Youtube but not much else. I was hoping to watch Amazon Prime 4K content but I can\'t. Vudu has a bunch of 4K UHD titles that I cannot watch using this 4K "Unified Entertainment System". That is pure marketing BS by Tivo and a major disappointment on a product with an ultra premium price tag. I thought I could get rid of my Roku for 4K content but boy was I wrong. Guidance from Tivo regarding future HDR capabilities would be helpful but customer service reps don\'t know what HDR is.

"The unit performed admirably once I got it up and running. The problem connecting it with the cable company wasn't with the DVR but the cable company's inability to properly pair the Motorola cable modem card that they provided. But after 3 days of going back and forth I finally got to a desk jockey at the local Vyve connection desk that was willing to go the extra mile and find the correct procedure for this relatively new model. Has performed flawlessly ever since. If you want to own your own DVR on your cable TV network then this is the one to get. 6 tuners means hardly ever a conflict of time with your favorite programs. And 3Tb of space provides ample room to save lots of programs. And if that isn't enough you can get an optional external drive. We've recorded many shows in the 26 days since it was connected and are only at 15% of the useable space on the hard drive."

Had the Comcast Guy set it up for me That was first week of October 2017,everything works great and fast. No problems at all.Love it.Its awesome.
eviewer Rating 5 out of 5 stars 
I\'m a long time user of Tivo and will continue to be. The Bolt+ is the best one yet. 3TB hard drive, 6 shows recording at once, and a GREAT user friendly interface. Also, I can\'t even begin to tell you how awesome the "skip commercials" feature is. Press the green button and it automatically skips them perfectly. It doesn\'t work for all channels, but it does on all the main ones. To be fair and post a downside ... comcast cable cards were a pain. Comcast doesn\'t really promote tivo or train their installers on how to set them up. So I had to call them back several times. I\'m honestly stunned that there aren\'t more tivo users out there. It\'s a perfect machine and I couldn\'t feel happier about my purchase.

"This is the best TiVo DVR...until the next one. :) But this TiVo Bolt has so much room/space, that if you fill it halfway, you will be watching recorded shows/movies for days.
