"November 5, 2017","Long time tivo user, from Series 2, to Roamio, to Bolt.  Have a bunch of Minis to boot.  Do not buy the TiVo Mini VOX!  In short, it was not ready to be released.First and foremost, despite advertising with Amazon Video, and the Amazon Video app being installed on all my other devices, this one does not have an Amazon Video app.  For the hell of it, I tried downgrading it away from the Hydra interface, but no go.  It does not support Amazon Video and it’s false advertising/lies to be selling it as is.  Contacted TiVo support and they said they are working on it, but did not give a date for when it would be added.  It should not have been released without this completed.Next, Hydra.  I want to like Hydra but after numerous crashes and other issues, I downgraded my TiVo box along with the mini back to the old interface.  It’s way too buggy to use.  This is beta, or really alpha, software that needs another 6 months or more of fixes.For the $180 price tag especially, TiVo should have waited to ship this.  It’s just junk as it is now.
