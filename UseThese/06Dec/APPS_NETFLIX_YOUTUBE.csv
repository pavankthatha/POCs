26-04-2017,"hank you for writing to TiVo, Inc. We are always delighted to hear from our subscribers, particularly when they offer us an opportunity to address concerns and improve TiVo service. Certainly, your letter qualifies. In it, you state that your TiVo is programmed to automatically record three programs every week: 24, WWE Raw, and UFC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c The Ultimate Fighter. Based on these regularly recorded programs, as well as one-time only recordings like UFC 76: Knockout, the Tivo Suggestions function has recommended other programming it believes you will like. According to your letter, most of these suggestions are logical, although you do not always watch them. For example, TiVo suggested that you watch WWE Friday Night Smackdown! because you like WWE Raw, although you declined, feeling that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plotlines are pedestrian and don\xe2\x80\x99t move the human spirit\xe2\x80\x9d in the same way that WWE Raw does.",TechReviews,0.076867478,3,Neutral,APPS

You spent three pages ranting about the show, which TiVo suggested to you five times. In those pages, you berated TiVo for thinking you could enjoy a \xe2\x80\x9cstupid kids show\xe2\x80\x9d that features \xe2\x80\x9csome annoying 14-year old Disneyfied, popstar wannabe.\xe2\x80\x9d Apparently you felt particularly betrayed upon learning that Billy Ray Cyrus also starred, writing that you \xe2\x80\x9cactually ripped out a car radio and threw it on the highway\xe2\x80\x9d when your favorite radio station played \xe2\x80\x9cAchy Breaky Heart\xe2\x80\x9d during the height of its popularity.",TechReviews,0.015833333,3,Neutral,APPS

I am not paying $28 per month to Verizon for using outdated DVR technology (1 DVR, 1 extra box) - now I am only paying Verizon $5 monthly fee for renting a CableCard in addition to programming fees.2. Amazing picture quality. It certainly seems that my TV signal quality (I have a five year old high-end 1080p Sony Bravia TV) improved dramatically.3. TiVo Bolt is way faster and has a materially better UI than my old FiOS DVR.4. I can record four shows simultaneously at the same time v. two using FiOS boxes. Recording options are way more advanced on TiVo and greatly improve the overall experience.5. Ability to search for your desired content, be it shows, movies or whatever else across all of your services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, inter alia) is revolutionary. To that extend, I highly recommend getting a TiVo Slide Pro Remote which has a sensor-activated backlit keyboard and a Search button.6. TiVo Mini works extremely well and has no monthly fees whatsoever7. QuickMode works well but it takes time getting used to.8. The device itself is small, sleek and sexy.9.

It's very intuitive to use and I love accessing my DVR in the bedroom using my Galaxy and headphones at night with the TiVo app.The ability to skip commercials with many recorded shows and to increase the play back speed without decreasing sound legibility on programs like Antiques Roadshow is a great timesaver (and I don't fall asleep watching slow talking shows as much anymore). Occasionally, the unit will stop functioning, but his is usually after one of our too frequent Florida power outages. After contacting customer service, which was a good experience, I learned to just re-boot, the answer to most of life's electronic problems, and was back on line quickly. After 10 months, the unit paid for itself in DVR rental fees. I pay about $5.00 a month for a cable card, but that's nothing compared to $25.00 plus taxes on a unit that's not nearly as powerful and fun to use at the Bolt.We didn't buy the lifetime service for the guide because I was a bit nervous not knowing how long our box would last. I will probably kick myself if we're paying a guide fee that will start this November for two years, because that's the pay off point. By then, though, I may be tempted to get the latest and greatest new Bolt.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"March 7, 2017","Love Love Love this device	Love Love Love this device.  I can ""cut the chord"" and record (and pre-set recordings) for all HD broadcast shows.  Especially handy during college football and basketball seasons.  Never miss a game (especially since Sling rarely has any games in replay!).  Easy to use user interface.  Easy set up (I mean VERY easy).  I set my entire TIVO box in about 30 minutes including ""cycling"" times and connecting HD OTA antenna.  Great multi-functional remote that takes over TV, live streaming, and OTA broadcast functionality (except if you have Sling which requires ROKU etc).  If you are thinking of cutting the chord and minimize streaming services/costs AND you don't want to wait until Hulu posts a certain show (or doesn't at all like ""Quantico"" that has to record OTA or with a special subscription to a cable company affiliated with ABC!!) then this is a GREAT option to ""cut the chord"" with cable companies and allow you to only subscribe/purchase the minimum streaming services to get exclusive stuff like ESPN and Fox. With the TIVO Bolt, I've cut my cable costs by about 70% --- currently have Sling $20 (for ESPN mainly-- requires a ROKU stick that you can get for free from Sling), HULU w/ Showtime add-on and commercial free option $21, Netflix for certain Netflix only shows $8.  My Amazon Prime membership I have for my purchases includes Amazon video so it's a ""sunk cost"" so I don't really include it as a ""streaming cost"" since I'd have Amazon regardless of what comes with it.

"April 6, 2016","Let's be honest...	Let's be honest -- TiVo isn't for everyone, but it IS for me and my family.  There are certainly less expensive options, particularly if you're a cord cutter. However, if you are like me, and have wife that watches Discovery ID (or some other cable channel) AND Netflix constantly and has ZERO tolerance for input switching or other ""technical BS"" -- this is the best option.  TiVo just works with everything, and seamlessly integrates cable with online options.  It's also pricey.. but if you're stuck with cable like I am, you may already be paying a stupidly high cable bill.  At that point, just suck it up and buy the stupid thing... you'll be happier for it. Worst part? No doubt about it, its working with your cable company for the cable card, etc.  Again, just suck it up and go for it.  I think you'll be happy you did.They finally got it right with the Bolt.  It did take a while... the Premiere model was slow.  The Roamio was (and is) a great option... but the Bolt fixes what was left. Here's what I liked about it vs. the Roamio: 1) smaller; 2) quieter; 3) 4K (not that it really matters much, yet); 4) gigabit ethernet; 5) 1 year of service included (if you buy before May 2016).  It's not all perfect.. like a lot of technology there are some quirks.  I did have an issue with audio dropouts along with my Sony TV and Sonos Playbar.  I do think it was an issue with the Sony, because when I plugged the optical direct from the TiVo to the Playbar the problem went away... I switch the audio source to PCM on both the TV and the TiVo.  All set.People look at me funny when I tell them I have TiVo... I don't thi",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"February 7, 2016","A bit of a pain to set up, a dream once you do!	I had DirecTV for years, and I loved it- the only thing was the price of programming in addition to cable prices started to really add up. I went down to basic cable with Charter.  I found it unusable after all of my years with satellite. The OS of the HD cable box was so dang UGLY and doing everything (On demand, guide, etc) was such an absolute chore.  I knew I needed something new.  I had Tivo back in the day when they were in business with DIrecTV, and I decided to give it a shot.  I read some of the reviews how things were so difficult in dealing with the cable company and the antiquated, dreaded cable card! Let me tell you- it was a bit of a chore. Getting the card was east enough, but you need to have an adapter (provided by Charter) in addition to getting the card. You will need another coax cable to run from the adapter to the TIvo box.  They did not give me one at the cable company, so be aware.  The software of the Tivo did get hung up at 72% while it was downloading the information from the cable- it seems like this was something that has happened to many people.  I called the cable company again and had them unpair and pair the cable card again.  After a bit, it worked, and it's a dream. It does take 1-2 hours to get it all set up.  Be patient, and know that once everything gets put together from the cable company side, it works like a charm.  When you combine this with Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu- you'll be amazed at the amount of content that is beautifully presented and easily accessed.  I can't see a way for it to be better.

Skip mode is great, one button press to seamlessly cut through the entire commercial segment and it lands you a few seconds before the show resumes.What I like most about the Tivo Bolt is how it incorporates Live TV, DVR, as well as popular streaming services into one easy to use interface.  Want to watch the live Sports game?  Bam, ok you're done.  Want to watch something from Netflix or Amazon Video?, you no longer have to switch inputs or mess around with another piece of hardware like a Roku or AppleTV.  The Tivo Bolt lets you watch shows from Netflix, Amazon and others just as easy as if you were going to a Live TV station.It's a game changer device IMO.  Combine the Bolt with Mini's around the home and you now have a unified media network that will stream LiveTV, RecordedTV around the house and also play stuff from the best streaming services.So much better than having to deal with the punitive pricing structure of Cable and Satellite providers who punish their subscribers for using multiple TV's.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"October 4, 2015","Great Entry Level DVR with a lot of Capability	Purchased from a B&M retailer. This is my first foray into the Tivo world and so far I am impressed. I had no issues with installation or activation of any services (I have FiOS). My HD and premium stations all work perfectly. The Bolt itself is small and lightweight; considerably smaller than my old STB.It did take a little while to activate but once complete and fully updated, the system is running well. I'm not a hardcore DVR person by any means whatsoever - I just wanted some recording capability and a better interface than the typical Verizon STB and this thing blows it out of the water. There are few apps at the moment but I fully expect this to change in the future. I believe Tivo has a lot in store for the Bolt. Amazon Prime and Netflix work great and integration with the iPhone also works well. 500GB is relatively small for a DVR, but expandable storage is doable via eSata. For me personally, this is a non-issue. Despite the 4K, I don't think this level of storage and 2 fewer tuners are enough for the hardcore DVR users out there, but for those simply wanting a better experience than their cable providers STB, this is a solid way to go.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS

This would allow me to ditch my cable companies dvr box and dvr service. When I heard about the TiVo Bolt I decided it was time. I've had the TiVo for a week and so far I love this thing. Far more options than I had with my cable supplied dvr box. The TiVo programming and recording is pretty simple. For those considering making the switch you'll find that the TiVo has everything you get from your cable company box, plus a whole lot more. For me the perks are the commercial skip, although not available on every show, it's available on many of the shows I record. Also the QuickPlay feature is good for watching shows that you may have stockpiled. Bing watch in less time. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, and more are all easily accessible. As well as Spotify (although you need a full membership to access it), I Heart Radio and On Demand (depending on your cable provider). Now, the down side. I set mine up a week ago, it's taken that week to access everything. I had the cable card (required to get your cable channels) I had a wireless connection (required to access the TiVo guide and features). But I couldn't get everything to talk to one another. My first problem was getting the MAC address to talk to my router. My set up requires me to enter the MAC address for whatever I connect wirelessly.

The iPhone app works pretty much flawlessly for scheduling and viewing recorded content (and I can use my iPhone as a remote control if I can't find the remote!)  The commercial skip is really effective on the shows that support it.  Configuration with the Comcast cable system was time consuming but straightforward and we experienced no issues there.

I've upgraded from FIOS DVR to Xfinity cable-card and it is saving me money over their rental unit, less boxes and cables next to my TV, lower power consumption, and just a significantly better DVR.

The Tivo Bolt looked like it would do what I wanted and had good reviews on various sites.Well, I'm happy to say, I'm another positive reviewer. It's been great. I won't list all the features here cause it's on the website. But one of the things I like is that the Bolt is recording on all 4 tuners at the same time.

Then I got this Bolt and it is a night and day difference from the terrible Comcast DVR box.  The user interface is much easier to navigate and the channel guide is head and shoulders above the Comcast guide.There are so many features on the Bolt that are better than the Comcast DVR. The one that I appreciate the most is the ""Skip"" button.  Being able to completely and effortlessly skip commercials in recorded TV shows in invaluable.  This feature alone is worth the price of admission.Another feature that I love is the integration of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.  For the first time since we have been subscribing to Netflix and Amazon Prime are we actually getting our money's worth.  We have a smart TV and an smart BR player with Netflix and Amazon apps but it was way too cumbersome and the apps were hard to navigate.  The Bolt  makes watching Netflix and Amazon so simple and we are watching much much more from Netflix and Amazon.Another feature that I love is the iOS/Android Tivo app that lets you watch live/recorded TV on your smartphone/tablet.  You can stream the show on your home network or download the show for viewing outside your home.  The Bolt does not have the capability to stream to an external network, yet.The last ""feature"" that I appreciate is the cost savings.

"December 7, 2015","Leader of the Pack!	So far, we love it! SkipMode is our favorite feature. The fact that we can go from OTA channels to the streaming channels with one remote and one device is worth the cost. Tried other DVRs and found that the tuners in the TiVo are so much more stable and hold the OTA channels much better. The only negative thing I have experienced so far is when I dial in an OTA channel like 8 for example, it goes to 8-0 (I guess) where there is no station. I then have to channel up one to get to 8-1 since there is no dash key on the remote to type in. So you can't go directly to an OTA channel unless you do it via the guide. I would also ding TiVo for not having HULU as a menu option with the other streaming channels but I have been promised by tech support that it's coming soon. Make good on your promise TiVo! The lack of a HULU option is the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars.UPDATE:  12/08/2015 - I have been corrected on the ""dash"" issue.

"February 9, 2016","Love the Bolt!	I was pleasantly surprised how well this new unit works.  Much better than expected.  It appears to get as good or possibly better reception than my Sony 2014 TV gets.  I am using it in my RV after noting that my Directv Satellite only connects to channels I seldom watch.  Since I installed the Bolt, I have not gone back to the Satellite but once.  I get all my standard TV Stations via my RV powered antenna.  The recordings are great and the SKIP button amazing.  FF and Skip are nearly instant when using the RF Remote unlike my Directv Genie which has about a 2 second delay for everything.I am beginning to believe that cord cutting is the way to go.  This will save me over $100/month in fees and yet give me 95-98% of all the channels I care to watch.I connected my Netflix and Prime to the TiVo Bolt and noted that TiVo will actually show you which sources can provide the show you are looking for and play or record it.  Very intuitive and very fast.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"May 16, 2016","Well worth the investment!!	We've had this unit for a little over 2 months and it is an amazing system.  It took over 3 months to do my research and after finally knowing what I wanted and what the bolt is capable of giving I pulled the trigger and purchased right from the TiVo website.  We are now in full support of TiVo. I opted for the OTA which I installed inside my attic with a 65 mile range even though we are only 30 miles from tower. There are absolutely no pixilation issues at all and with the uncompressed HD signal quality by using OTA it is like night and day between dish, directv and cable companies which have a compressed HD signal. The recording features are impressive and the remote control is extremely responsive. We also have Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime ( which I will also say that all 3 have their own original shows now and is impressive as well ), Pandora and iheart radio. The icing on the cake for me is PLEX, by using my network attached storage with all of our dvd movies and bluray movies and music I'm able  to stream everything through the Bolt. Setup was pretty straight forward as I also opted to connect the Bolt via WIFI.  Take note however, if you connect your mini's do so through Moca and not wireless it's pretty easy just read the directions. It is really nice to not have to switch inputs on our television anymore. Love the skip mode. I have also already installed a western digital 1tb hard drive to this also for added DVR storage.The industry is in fact changing also, everyday to be exact. Having the Bolt does come with a yearly subscription around $149 ( truly this is not a bad deal people )",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"February 3, 2016","I love the TiVo Bolt recording	When I first 'cut the cord' I thought I'd have a tough time of it, and I did. But, I started to research what I could do just to be able to tell what was on TV at any given time. I discovered that there were a number of DVR devices on the market. My research led me to decide on getting the TiVo Bolt. Since then, I have not missed 'cable' at all. The only time I may miss it is during football season, but then I discovered that I can subscribe to 'Sling TV' which broadcast both ESPN & ESPN2. So, during football season I'll subscribe to that... I love the TiVo Bolt recording, program schedule along with the many features thereof, the 'skip' feature, etc. I figure that after the first year TiVo subscription, the $149/yr subscription fee beats $100/mo cable fee six ways to Sunday. Use the TiVo Bolt in conjunction with Netflix, or any of the other content providers and it's 100 times better than cable.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS

Much quicker responses to all controls!  We retired the old unit to our bedroom, and we discovered an added benefit, that the box's do link with each other and we can watch any recorded show from either room on either box - awesome - pause in living room, and continue in the bedroom.  Full menu from either box on each unit.  Don't know if i will be cutting the cord soon on cable- however with the program guide on the TIVO we can search across platforms such as the tivo, netflix, and Hulu for shows we like, and record them to the unit's for later viewing.  I will be upgrading to Lifetime service on this unit also, as soon as it comes down in price, or when TIVO runs a special on service.  The first year is free, and the guide is worth the monthly fee.  I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase - enjoy",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS
"July 28, 2016","Tivo gets a facelift !	I have been a TiVo customer since their launch. However over recent years, my old TiVo HD went on the shelf in favor of my Roku, Fire TV and Apple TV devices. However when the Bolt was launched I thought the concept of unifying my apps with my OTA TV on one HDMI connection to be an interesting one. So I decided to give it a try. It felt like an old friend having the peanut remote back in my hand, although it felt huge after my Apple TV 4 remote !So far it has lived up to expectations. I love the idea that you can add anything from Hulu, Netflix, HBO and Amazon to your watch list. It extends the size of the drive because all streaming services stream direct from the source, bypassing the drive. As for my OTA recordings, I love the commercial skip feature on the main networks. This alone helps justly the annual TiVo fee, because I detest the interruption of commercials !Talking about the fee, I do feel that it's a bit much and logistically with all the competition out there, I would hope to see a change in their pricing structure in the near future.To sum up I think this device brings TiVo bang up to date, with the combination of the old features we were familiar with and some great new ones.All we need now is for the service fee to drop a little and you'll have a near perfect device to meet all your streaming and network needs.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS

No need for a smart TV, ROKU, Apple TV, Satellite TV, or Cable TV. I connected it to my Moho HD  antenna and it gets great reception. The tuner on the TiVo bolt is better than the one on my TV.  It has a very well Integrated interface with over the air shows, recorded shows, NetFlix shows, and Amazon Prime shows. It has one easy to use interface to see all your TV show options on one screen! On top of this, you can stream any content from your Bolt to your phones or tablets in your home, porch or yard. You can also connect to your TiVo app from your phone or tablet while not home, to remotely set a program to record! Finish that show you were watching at a friends house when you get home! The one button instant skip mode on most recorded shows, is super cool as you get there instantly without fast forward guessing! If I ever need more recording  space I can simply attach an eSATA hard drive. Do not forget to buy a MoCA POE Filter to prevent your Bolt from transmitting your home internet signal via your coax connected antenna. The Bolt turns your connected antenna coax into an MoCA (Multimedia over Coax) allowing the connected coax in your house to be used for antenna or wired internet via the coax. This built in feature allows you to use your house coax to connect a TiVo mini to other rooms in your house that have coax already run and allow full access to your TiVo Bolt programming and features on other TVs via this coax or other wired Ethernet cables.Have fun being fully connec",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS

I love that it searches for shows across multiple providers (cable, Amazon, Vudu, Netflix), and that I can skip past commercials.  Also love that it replaces both my Verizon DVR and my Roku which saves space.  I hated that my Roku transmitted as a Wifi Access point for its remote to function - so that box is now history!  I look forward to the ability to view my recorded programs remotely, which I believe is a feature that will be coming to the Bolt.  My wishlist for the next generation would be the ability to add a large USB harddrive full of my home movies to play through the Bolt interface.  Also, I don't like that they have a small ad at the bottom of the home screen.  I paid a lot of money for this box, do they really have to do that?

Extremely slick and intuitive design, flawless setup, instant responses, and the bonus was the built in MOCA bridge which made adding my 3 TIVO minis a snap. The commercial skip button is wonderful, OnePass setup for streaming (HULU, Netflix...) ensures that I don't miss any of my favorite shows.

I just switched to FIOS and was worried that the installer would be clueless when it came to anything other than Verizon equipment.  And I was right! His experience was limited to installing a cable card in a Tivo unit two years ago.  Nevertheless, between the two of us we were able to get the CableCard installed and activated in about 30 minutes.Updating the unit and getting it connected to the internet and my streaming services was very fast, easy and intuitive as is operation of the unit.  The box gives you a lot more customization choices than my old X1 DVR but the information is presented in a way that you are not overwhelmed with options.  The skip and quick mode are fantastic as is the ability to search across platforms.  The best part for a former cable company DVR renter like me?  The unit is blazing fast; you press a button and the channel switches instantaneously or the guide pages down quickly.  No more waiting through 1-2 seconds of lag time as your unit catches up.  The same is true with the selection of Amazon or Netflix titles--everything is fast and seamless the way it should be.The icing on the cake is that TIVO pays for itself within months and then some:  the TIVO Bolt and Mini I purchased (which works as well as the Bolt) will save me $45 a month in device rental and DVR fees.Nice work Tivo, keep up the good work and I look forward to future product updates that will allow for out of home streaming and access to FIOS on demand selections.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,APPS

Likely the costs are the same for your cable company.If you buy the Bolt for $299 and a Mini for $120 (and for completeness lets bake in the $150 a year for years 2 and 3 service) you will be paying $720 for the same 36 months.

This equates to the cost of the Tivo Bolt with service for 1 year, with the key difference is that after year 1, you can actually ""own"" the Tivo Bolt device (unlike the cable company's box.) Further, in year 2, the TiVO Bolt's cost is cheaper that the cable company's equivalent cost [for DVR box and service] by a whopping 50% since you then only pay the Bolt's $150 subscription fee and no further cost for the Bolt device. On these grounds alone, the Bolt makes great economic sense!I like the fact that Bolt is lightweight and has a chic bent design. I am disappointed, however, that there are no heat vents on the top of the device as is the case with most DVR boxes.

I wish I could stream outside the home like Slingbox can. That feature is sorely missed. I also wish Tivo Minis were less expensive or that I could use my appleTV like a TiVo mini.I would pay $40 for an app that let me use my appletv box as a TiVo mini.

"December 28, 2015","Great product but incomplete...  5th star to be added!	Just like any other new product to the market, the TiVo Bolt has its shortcomings BUT thanks to incredible customer support and service the Bolt has the potential to be perfect.The user interface is friendly and easy to use.  My wife, who isn't the most tech savvy person, uses it flawlessly and has no problems finding he favorite shows and movies.  Initial setup was relatively easy to include setting up MoCA with a required 'filter'.  The Bolt works flawlessly with Comcast's cable card and I have have access to all of my media.  The manner in which the Bolt searches through the many services (Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, etc) is what truly sets it apart.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.My only complaint is that the Bolt currently does not offer Out-Of-Home streaming and this is a must have option for me... especially during football season.  I do a lot of international travel.  I hope this option will be activated soon as it has been promised by mid-2016.

A year later, and I couldn't imagine TV without this machine. It's terrific, and will only get better.Channel changes and tuning is crisp and rapid. Season Pass is terrific, allowing automatic recording of all your favorite shows. Streaming services are integrated, so say goodbye to switching inputs. The classic Tivo Peanut remote is comfortable, intuitive, and durable. A great feature of the remote is it's use of IR/RF, eliminating the need for line of sight. This is great for me, as I keep the unit behind a cabinet door.Monthly service fees are cheaper than those of the cable company, making the Tivo that much more attractive an alternative to the terrible DVRs that the cable companies offer.You will need a cable card for most channels. Premium channels, such as NFL network, will require a tuning adapter as well. Cable card fees are about three dollars a month, and I'm not charged for the tuning adapter.The bolt loses a star with me for it's dumb design. Yes, it's ugly looking, but it's fatal flaw is a lack of top vents, resulting in a unit that runs alarmingly hot. So hot, in fact, that it will certainly shorten it's service life.

Color me more than a little disappointed, and if drives don't soon become available, color me looking for a class-action suit for false advertising to join.No access to any On-Demand services from Time-Warner; not a fault of TiVo, but it would have been nice to know.Cancelled shows frequently show as due to lack of space, when that isn't the case; original time slot moved, channel not available, etc. This combined with the sudden disappearance of expansion drives makes for more paranoia than necessary about capacity.Another casualty of going to the cable card (and another Time-Warner, not TiVo problem) is a number of channels are no longer available without a Time-Warner DVR or purchase of additional packages.

"November 12, 2015","An Honest Opinion	I migrated from a Roamio OTA 4- tuner to the Bolt for one reason. That was the Commercial Skip feature. The information provided by TIVO concerning the parameters as to which programs would be targeted was very misleading (I understood shows from the top 20 networks between 4 pm thru midnight to cover the late night shows). I still do not know what is covered but I did get a response to one of my surveys which stated that just because a show was marked SKIP once does not mean that each current episode would be so marked. This is disappointing and deceptive. Concerning those shows that do get tagged, the feature works very well 99% of the time. Some are dead on, some are off by a second or two. A few times the beginning SKIP is omitted but I know once the commercial starts to hit the CHANNEL FORWARD (this is by far a better choice than the D button for this elderly old fellow). So I am 85% happy with the feature and hope that the number of shows are increased. Even though I am still paying for my subscription on the Roamio (I knew that I would be), I genuinely feel that the move was very worthwhile. Even though I have a 4K Smart TV and can get to Netflix directly to view those such movies in 4K, the Netflix app on the TIVO offers the same. Hence, one less remote to mess with.

Add a TiVo Mini to your home network and you can duplicate this experience on other television's, with the Bolt's 4 available tuners.To give credit where credit is due, TiVo's user interface is a key differentiation.  The archaic and lackluster interface from my cable provider is proof they don't focus on the user experience.  Once you've TiVo'ed, life just isn't the same.  The screens pop, the sounds are warm, the searches are comprehensive and quick and your recorded content is easily sorted.  Some other streaming devices come close, such as the Kindle Fire interface, but I still find TiVo's to be superior in organization and ease of use aside from the sheer power of offering one place to access all available content.I really like that when I look for a movie title or TV show this one device interrogates my cable providers programming, current recorded content, Netflix and Amazon accounts.

Commercial skip on late night channels only really needs to expand to the other channels. Search across different sources like Netflix and cable is great too. However, the lack of apps like HBO Now makes this limited. The box also needs to be able to accommodate OTA and Cable, not one or the other. I had gotten used to watching local channels OTA because OTA picture quality is a significant improvement over the HD cable signal (I'm guessing it's their horrible compression that degrades cable picture quality). However, I'm still stuck in the situation of swapping inputs for watching OTA and Cable with the Bolt - this also means the unified search feature cannot include both sources either. That is disappointing. The remote commands transferred to my Harmony One perfectly. However, the TiVo remote seems to be missing Page Up and Page Down on the channel guide.

It is so much smaller and tucks away and the RF remote is a nice convenience so I can stash it even more out of sight.  The DVR experience has always been superior to the cable companies and I love how Tivo has much better algorithms to record and recommend shows.

The Mini also works well and eliminates the need to buy several devices and monthly services as long as you have a good home network.  Netflix, Amazon, and HBOGO all work fairly smoothly with the Tivo as a go between and there is plenty of storage.

"April 29, 2016","Buyer beware	Very important that you read the description of this device very carefully. The advertisements would lead you to believe that you can truly watch shows from your TiVo bolt anywhere in the world. This is mostly untrue. You cannot stream video outside of your home network.  In addition, although I was not able to find this anywhere in the product description or on the TiVo website, you cannot download any show that is not broadcast on a basic network. In other words, if you want to download something from ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX  then you are in good shape. However, if you wish to download a show from any other station you probably will not be allowed to.  I have tried shows on TBS, TCM, FX, AMC, IFC, etc. and each time receive a notice that my device does not allow download of premium content.  Even Tivo support has not been willing to admit to this restriction. They keep telling me to reset my device but at the end of the day, this unit does not allow downloading except from a very few stations. Having said all of this, if you are OK with these limitations this is a terrific DVR.  It is lightning fast and actually makes Netflix and Amazon video usable.",Amazon,-0.45,2,Negative,APPS

I now have to put it in standby mode when I done watching TV, or else it will not restart again without first unplugging the HDMI on the back of the TV while I reboot the Tivo. This is my fourth Tivo and I am a huge fan of TiVo, but this one seems to have some kind of software issue that is ongoing. TiVo support via Twitter chat has been helpful, but has not solved the issue I'm having. The most recent issue was with Netflix which would not stream (screen turned green) -- I switched to my Apple TV and Netflix ran perfectly, so I know the issue was not with Netflix. I am getting tired of unplugging the HDMI cable every couple of hours just to watch regular TV, and at this point I'm not sure what to do. The TV I have is a brand new Vizio 4K which is why i wanted a 4K Tivo. Other than the current issue, I am quite satisfied with TiVo Bolt, but when things go wrong, you're kind of out of luck.

"December 4, 2015","Half baked product not ready for Prime Time.  A real disappointment.	First time Tivo user.  I've had the Bolt for a month+ now and am frustrated enough to finally post my review.Does it record my OTA TV shows?  Yes.  This is one of the reasons I purchased it.  2 starsDoes it come close to eliminating my need for other devices so that I can watch Hulu, PLEX, Netflix etc.?  Not quite.  I finally gave up on using the Bolt for Plex and went back to my Fire TV box.  Too many lockups and strange occurrences with the Bolt.  No Hulu is a huge negative for me.  I also bought the Tivo Mini in hopes that I could get Hulu through it in another room.  NO GO.  Simply too buggy...maybe because it links to the Bolt and the Bolt doesn't have Hulu yet?Overall design leaves a lot to be desired.  The plug itself took up 2+ spots on my power distribution unit.  Could they not have come up with a better design?  Noisy fan from time to time?  Yes!Usable right out of the box?  NO!  I had to run through the setup and then wait for many hours for the unit to update/activate.  Welcome to 2008.Lastly - What is with all of the ADS that clutter the interface and pop up when I pause a show?  FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line is that I am sorry I purchased this.

And I have asked for support many times, and every time they have me connect to the TIVO network and reset the Guide, still doesn't work. As well, there are channels in our area that don't show up on the guide, so it will not let me add them to the list (I'm not allowed to watch locals I guess?), yet the smart-tv has no problem with them. Our BOLTS (x2) both stopped playing APPS (Netflix, Hulu, etc) through the Gig cable that I ran directly to the router, no love there, yet, switch to the smart TV that is connected to a 100M switch, and we watch Netflix no problem. The latest 2016 patch fiasco made a mess of the guides and we are unable to record FOX or KCOP now. Thanks TIVO.

I would hate for a singleTV, streamer, like me to have the same issue and be stuck with the device because again, if you realize your mistake too late, support is not helpful.Hello,I purchased the TiVo Bolt last year around this time because I was looking to save money from renting the cable box from the cable provider and as a Netflix, Hulu+, amazon prime, and HBOgo subscriber I wanted an option for streaming in case I did decide to cut the cord.

They are banking on you not noticing the charge, and when you do notice, not letting you cancel if it's not the exact date the contract ends, charging early termination fees, and sending your bill to collections. They have turned from what used to be a great, fun company into a Comcast style evil bag.The BOLT itself is horrible. It does not serve 4k signal to my 4k TV- and barely has enough storage to really hold much 4k video. The included applications (Netflix, Amazon) crash to a pink screen of death after about 3 seconds of video.  It runs as slow as the rest of the TiVos.

"February 25, 2016","First TiVo and loving every aspect of it!	Due to increasing cable costs, I've been trying find ways to cut my bill. For awhile I've been considering getting a TiVo. This would allow me to ditch my cable companies dvr box and dvr service. When I heard about the TiVo Bolt I decided it was time. I've had the TiVo for a week and so far I love this thing. Far more options than I had with my cable supplied dvr box. The TiVo programming and recording is pretty simple. For those considering making the switch you'll find that the TiVo has everything you get from your cable company box, plus a whole lot more. For me the perks are the commercial skip, although not available on every show, it's available on many of the shows I record. Also the QuickPlay feature is good for watching shows that you may have stockpiled. Bing watch in less time. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, and more are all easily accessible. As well as Spotify (although you need a full membership to access it), I Heart Radio and On Demand (depending on your cable provider). Now, the down side. I set mine up a week ago, it's taken that week to access everything. I had the cable card (required to get your cable channels) I had a wireless connection (required to access the TiVo guide and features). But I couldn't get everything to talk to one another. My first problem was getting the MAC address to talk to my router. My set up requires me to enter the MAC address for whatever I connect wirelessly. However you need to do a software upgrade as soon as you start the TiVo. Not possible if you can't connect wirelessly.

I upgraded from a TiVo HD to the TiVo Bolt.The new TiVo Bolt works great with Comcast XFINITY cable TV and the other internet video services I use (like Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube).I like the speed of the new TiVo. The new user interface, while taking a few days to get used to, is really an improvement.  The new remote control is great (and not having to point it at the TiVo is wonderful!)  The iPhone app works pretty much flawlessly for scheduling and viewing recorded content (and I can use my iPhone as a remote control if I can't find the remote!)  The commercial skip is really effective on the shows that support it.  Configuration with the Comcast cable system was time consuming but straightforward and we experienced no issues there.  There was a little hiccup when I tried connecting the Extender Drive from our old TiVo, but a new cable fixed that and we are up and running with 1.5TB of storage.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,APPS

Using with OTA (painful to get right for apt at first but now works) but if I have to add basic tv to my cable package, the real hidden value diamond is having my own equipment makes negotiating post promo rates on net or tv w cable company a cinch!  If I cant get promo rates I cancel & my wife simply becomes new subscriber getting promo rates.  Also when you back out the cost of the 1 yr service included $280-$150(would pay more anyway to cable company) and the cost of stream function already included ($130) essentially the box is free.  They are marketing this all wrong, they should show the value above & finance or lease these things to make it easy, then work out local antenna install options like amazon does.  Its not about saving $ on dvr rental but flexibility of having good dvr/content aggregator without having to step up to large channel packages or losing dvr content if you cancel.
