27-04-2016,"TiVo Bolt dramatically improved my Verizon FiOS TV experience. Love it!!	I am comparing TiVo Bolt with standard Verizon FiOS 320Gb DVR (not new, more expensive Quantum FiOS).Pros:1. I am not paying $28 per month to Verizon for using outdated DVR technology (1 DVR, 1 extra box) - now I am only paying Verizon $5 monthly fee for renting a CableCard in addition to programming fees.2. Amazing picture quality. It certainly seems that my TV signal quality (I have a five year old high-end 1080p Sony Bravia TV) improved dramatically.3. TiVo Bolt is way faster and has a materially better UI than my old FiOS DVR.4. I can record four shows simultaneously at the same time v. two using FiOS boxes. Recording options are way more advanced on TiVo and greatly improve the overall experience.5. Ability to search for your desired content, be it shows, movies or whatever else across all of your services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, inter alia) is revolutionary. To that extend, I highly recommend getting a TiVo Slide Pro Remote which has a sensor-activated backlit keyboard and a Search button.6. TiVo Mini works extremely well and has no monthly fees whatsoever7. QuickMode works well but it takes time getting used to.8. The device itself is small, sleek and sexy.9. TiVO recording can be pulled up using Amazon Fire / Amazon Fire Stick allowing kids to watch recorded shows on secondary TVs (however see below)10. I now have three times (3x) more space to play with on my DVR.So-so:1. Skip Mode, which fully skips commercials with a click of a button is incredible when it is available. In my experience, it is available only on ~33% of the shows I",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

"September 25, 2016","Stop renting your DVR and paying taxes every month. This works great and is fun to use!	We decided to reduce our cable bill has much as possible by buying our own equipment last year. We selected the TiVo Bolt because it was 4K compatible and because the guide and search features across all the platforms we use, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, was included. We've had it almost a year and I couldn't be happier. It's very intuitive to use and I love accessing my DVR in the bedroom using my Galaxy and headphones at night with the TiVo app.The ability to skip commercials with many recorded shows and to increase the play back speed without decreasing sound legibility on programs like Antiques Roadshow is a great timesaver (and I don't fall asleep watching slow talking shows as much anymore). Occasionally, the unit will stop functioning, but his is usually after one of our too frequent Florida power outages. After contacting customer service, which was a good experience, I learned to just re-boot, the answer to most of life's electronic problems, and was back on line quickly. After 10 months, the unit paid for itself in DVR rental fees. I pay about $5.00 a month for a cable card, but that's nothing compared to $25.00 plus taxes on a unit that's not nearly as powerful and fun to use at the Bolt.We didn't buy the lifetime service for the guide because I was a bit nervous not knowing how long our box would last. I will probably kick myself if we're paying a guide fee that will start this November for two years, because that's the pay off point. By then, though, I may be tempted to get the latest and greatest new Bolt.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"September 2, 2016","Worth it for skip feature alone!	My TiVo was about nine years old, and we had it on an older TV set. When we finally updated to a HD TV my old TiVo couldn't handle 1080p, and if a show isn't on the TiVo we're pretty much just not going to watch. I was hesitant to update the TiVo because my goal is to get rid of cable eventually, but I'm glad I did. I know there may have been good TiVos after my old one, but I think this one is the only one with skip capability and I LOVE IT. If I show doesn't have skip I get irritated that I have to manually fast forward through the commercials. And the upgrade of how many shows we can record at the same time is helpful. We don't keep movies etc on the TiVo so we didn't need the higher capacity and we find there is enough storage for what we need, just a few shows a week that we delete as we watch. If you like to keep shows and movies too re-watch it would be worth it to get the higher capacity.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"May 2, 2016","The Cadillac of DVRs	This is my third TIVO purchase since 2001. I have used other DVRs but I keep coming back to them. This time I cut the cord and use this as a combo receiver and DVR. This company just seems to ""get it"", their recorders offer more. TV should be simple. This keeps your antenna, various streams, YouTube and even Pandora all off one easy to surf menu. The OnePass options to have a permanent constantly renewing list by genre, TV Show, actor, etc, is just one of many functions that has come standard with Tivos that others are still slow to catch on to, and the new function of commercial skip (where applicable) does what it says it does...jump the entire commercial break with a press of a button and back to the show.The only new function I can't speak to is the Fast Play, which is not an option I would choose to turn on, but for binge watchers I could see how something like that would be useful. If you are cutting the cord and can make the investment, this is worth every penny, easily the Cadillac of DVRs.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"November 17, 2015","Awsome!	The best DVR available.  Skip mode is great, one button press to seamlessly cut through the entire commercial segment and it lands you a few seconds before the show resumes.What I like most about the Tivo Bolt is how it incorporates Live TV, DVR, as well as popular streaming services into one easy to use interface.  Want to watch the live Sports game?  Bam, ok you're done.  Want to watch something from Netflix or Amazon Video?, you no longer have to switch inputs or mess around with another piece of hardware like a Roku or AppleTV.  The Tivo Bolt lets you watch shows from Netflix, Amazon and others just as easy as if you were going to a Live TV station.It's a game changer device IMO.  Combine the Bolt with Mini's around the home and you now have a unified media network that will stream LiveTV, RecordedTV around the house and also play stuff from the best streaming services.So much better than having to deal with the punitive pricing structure of Cable and Satellite providers who punish their subscribers for using multiple TV's.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"July 11, 2016","Love the Bolt, but there are a few things to be aware of....	We mostly love the Tivo Bolt.  We've been using it for about a few months now and here are our thoughts...Things We love:1. SUPER SKIP!!! It is amazing, just push one little button at the start of a commercial break and BAM, you're back to your show!2. 4 Tuners, we only had 2 on our TiVo Premiere 500 GB DVR (Old  Version) - Digital Video Recorder and Streaming Media Player - 2 Tuners and while I didn't think we needed more than 2 tuners most of the time, it was always annoying to miss an episode of a show when schedules got moved around and there were 3 things needing to record.3. We mostly upgraded because we got a free year of service when we purchased, which meant that we could upgrade our Tivo for just $120 if you considered that we were paying $15 a month for service anyways.  And after 6 years we figured a new Tivo for $120 was probably a smart idea in the long run.4. Still works with an Expandable Hard Drive, so we bought the smaller Tivo and transferred our Expandable Hard Drive from the Premiere to the Bolt and it's still compatible.  However we did watch and delete all programming off of it before moving it, Tivo says you can transfer programming in theory, but we couldn't ever get it to work.Things We don't love:1.  You know that spiny wheel that comes up during prime time when too many people are on the internet & Tivo's servers, it's not a software thing with your old Tivo, it still happens with the Bolt, don't buy the Bolt because you think it'll be faster to load, it's just as slow as any other.2.

"April 29, 2016","Commercial Skip Feature is the Greatest!	After a net realized price increase of 23% to my cable bill I decided enough was enough.  Like many so what if I get a zillion channels. Most of them are never watched because they are useless.  So I started off purchasing an HD antenna to get all that I really wanted which was network channels.I stumbled across the Tivo Bolt and one of many things that got my attention was the ""Commercial Skip"" feature! After reading about its functionality I thought to myself I ""need this feature!""  I despise commercials, especially when most times they are repeated over and over during the same show.  Also, the prescription drug commercials during prime time are on the top of my list for annoying as well.I will be the first to admit that I love my gadgets so to justify this purchase was simply the mathematics.  Since I cancelled cable which resulted in approximately a $50 a month savings. The Tivo Bolt service is $15 a month. Since the current special includes a year of service the net cost equates to a little over $55 bucks for the device. Not bad at all!My Tivo Bolt arrived yesterday and the setup was very easy. It took close to an hour but the majority of that time was downloading and installing updates. The channel scanner located all of my network channels and I was ready to go with no issues or errors.Things I like:1.  Commercial Skip is the best. I feel so empowered when I use it. A victory if you will.2.  I like the one stop shopping for video and entertainment. No more switching input sources, hdmi 1, hdmi 2, etc. to use another source for streaming or subscriptions.

"February 25, 2016","First TiVo and loving every aspect of it!	Due to increasing cable costs, I've been trying find ways to cut my bill. For awhile I've been considering getting a TiVo. This would allow me to ditch my cable companies dvr box and dvr service. When I heard about the TiVo Bolt I decided it was time. I've had the TiVo for a week and so far I love this thing. Far more options than I had with my cable supplied dvr box. The TiVo programming and recording is pretty simple. For those considering making the switch you'll find that the TiVo has everything you get from your cable company box, plus a whole lot more. For me the perks are the commercial skip, although not available on every show, it's available on many of the shows I record. Also the QuickPlay feature is good for watching shows that you may have stockpiled. Bing watch in less time. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, and more are all easily accessible. As well as Spotify (although you need a full membership to access it), I Heart Radio and On Demand (depending on your cable provider). Now, the down side. I set mine up a week ago, it's taken that week to access everything. I had the cable card (required to get your cable channels) I had a wireless connection (required to access the TiVo guide and features). But I couldn't get everything to talk to one another. My first problem was getting the MAC address to talk to my router. My set up requires me to enter the MAC address for whatever I connect wirelessly. However you need to do a software upgrade as soon as you start the TiVo. Not possible if you can't connect wirelessly.

"November 18, 2015","TiVo keeps getting better and better.	I upgraded from a TiVo HD to the TiVo Bolt.The new TiVo Bolt works great with Comcast XFINITY cable TV and the other internet video services I use (like Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube).I like the speed of the new TiVo. The new user interface, while taking a few days to get used to, is really an improvement.  The new remote control is great (and not having to point it at the TiVo is wonderful!)  The iPhone app works pretty much flawlessly for scheduling and viewing recorded content (and I can use my iPhone as a remote control if I can't find the remote!)  The commercial skip is really effective on the shows that support it.  Configuration with the Comcast cable system was time consuming but straightforward and we experienced no issues there.  There was a little hiccup when I tried connecting the Extender Drive from our old TiVo, but a new cable fixed that and we are up and running with 1.5TB of storage.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"May 1, 2016","Great Upgrade	Fantastic upgrade to my Series 3.  I was a bit bummed that I couldn't keep my existing rate, but the free year makes up for it.  The interface is even better and more intuitive than before.  I wish I had made the switch immediately after the release.The Skip Mode is nice, but so rare for what I watch, it's not a huge selling point.  Also, I don't find the One Pass terribly helpful add I don't subscribe to Hulu and it links to Paid Amazon content rather than Prime...So I find it a bit annoying I can't have it recognize what is substitution based vs what I already pay for.  Obviously this is easy to ignite with the click of a button.Swapping cable cards was a snap and quickly recognized.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"January 7, 2016","Love my new TiVo	First, I must say, I love this Tivo box.  That said, here's what I would like enhanced and fixed.1.  It needs more tuners.  I have two minis and I find that sometimes I have to put one in standby to watch live tv on the other.2.  The bolt cannot keep up with the required 30 sec skips all the time and gets locked from further skips.3.  I have a tuning adapter attached to the bolt.  I think it would be an enhancement if there was a ""tuning adapter"" coax out on the bolt.  It would simply be a moca filtered split from the input coax jack.  That would take all the mis-configuration problems out of using  a tuning adapter.4.  Tivo suggestions need to be a little ""smarter"".  I constantly delete all the ""sports"" suggestions and then find them back again.5. The ""lifetime"" subscription option needs to be revisited.  I expect within 3 to 4 years, TiVo will have more and better equipment offering.  Why would I pay 4 year subscription fees up front to save what I would most likely not need four years later?  If I bought a lifetime subscription, you can guarantee that I will do everything not to have to buy your latest equipment offerings.Finally, overall, I love the bolt and tivo service.  I am saving $36 a month on my Charter bill.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

"March 23, 2016","Love It!	Loved my Tivo Premiere, love this more. Setup was easy - just paired it with my old cablecard and I was off and running. It's much faster than the Premiere, all the apps work well, and has the benefit of commercial skip which has worked with virtually every current running program. It doesn't work with older programs or recorded movies but that isn't a big deal. The menu is nearly identical to the updated Premiere menu so there was no learning curve. In addition I set up a Mini in my son's room which was an absolute breeze using MoCA. The only problem I encountered was that I had set it on my DVD player (yes, a 9 year old DVD player that works perfectly!) and the heat from the Tivo (which is considerable) caused the DVD player to seize up! A little rearranging after the player cooled down solved the problem. But the heat output is something to keep in mind.For those complaining about the $14.99 a month charge after the first year just keep in mind that it is WAY more than that for the cable company's DVR on a monthly and they don't have anything that equals the Mini which doesn't have any additional monthly charge.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

The wife loves it compared to the kludgy HDHomerun/WMC/NPVR setup I had been running. I wish it used a 3.5"" drive instead of 2.5"" for larger and cheaper upgrades. The TiVo app for iOS and Android works great. I'm also running the TiVo beta app on my Firestick and it works well enough but I plan on getting a TiVo mini in the near future.I hate the color and design of the box.

I coupled the BOLT with a TiVo mini which resulted in a great savings as I was paying the monthly service on one Premier plus the fee for the cable card. What I'm saving will pay for the TiVo mini in less than a year. The commercial skip feature is awesome and the menus are much faster. It's also quieter and takes up less space. The funky shape isn't a big deal as it sits right on top of our Blue-Ray player in the entertainment center without any issue. Highly recommend.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

The ""speed"" feature is really great - things go faster yet the voices maintain their same pitch.  A recorded football game or even a fast-moving basketball game is easy to watch and you get through it so much faster.

Since I hardly ever watch ""live"" TV anymore, the ability to set up a recording so easily is awesome. And the options are also awesome. With my new Digital Antenna mounted outside, I get ALL of the local channels, and with N****x and A*****n P****e, who needs anything else? The only thing I had a problem with was programming the remote. As awesome as everything else is, you'd think that little chore would be a whole lot simpler/easier.

It can easily be seen the upgrade didn't cost me much.What am I doing w/two remotes operating Tivo?  Won't say, but hint - the remote uses RF to control the Tivo box.Performance/Aesthetic/UI Improvements:- Remote is white and does not show dirt, it seems ligher, the quality of the Tivo button in particular is improved- UI now uses a more modern white background- The white curved Tivo is very cool looking. Much cooler than the Roamio- Have not tested the commercial skip feature - its vaporware  unless you watch soap operas during the day. Would have been really handy during the Republican Presidential debate- The UI is much faster. Screens snap. Everything is faster-Streaming in 2nd room is much faster. Faster queuing and less buffering-wifi is much faster-Tivo refunded me back the last month of Roamio which had just begun.Definately worth upgrading!Update:  Suddenly as I began to fast-forward, a prompt appeared asking me if I wanted to skip the commercial by hitting D on my remote.

Using with OTA (painful to get right for apt at first but now works) but if I have to add basic tv to my cable package, the real hidden value diamond is having my own equipment makes negotiating post promo rates on net or tv w cable company a cinch!  If I cant get promo rates I cancel & my wife simply becomes new subscriber getting promo rates.  Also when you back out the cost of the 1 yr service included $280-$150(would pay more anyway to cable company) and the cost of stream function already included ($130) essentially the box is free.  They are marketing this all wrong, they should show the value above & finance or lease these things to make it easy, then work out local antenna install options like amazon does.

"May 29, 2016","Much better than cable company DVR's	I had a Tivo about 7 years ago and ended up returning it because it just would not work properly with Charter Communications.  I gave it one more shot and bought this Tivo to go with my Time Warner cable.  I am glad to say that this time, it works great. **IMPORTANT information - If you are having the cable company come out to do the install, plug in your Tivo box a least a day before and have it do it's updates.  I didn't realize this and still had the Tivo box in it's packaging when the cable company arrived to do the install.  The tech told me that the over the air update process for the Tivo box takes up to 24 hours and that he could not install it until it was updated.  The tech ended up installing the rest of the system and not the Tivo.  I had to plug the Tivo box into the outlet, hook up the WiFi and then let it go through the setup and update process.  Unlike what the tech said, the whole process only took about 1.5 hours.  Either way, you should be aware of this and have it ready to go if someone is going to hookup this box for you.I love the features on this Tivo.  The commercial skip button is very convenient to have and I really use the Amazon prime video app a lot on my Tivo.  I've had DVR's from Directv, AT&T, Charter Cable, and Time Warner Cable before.  I think it's a toss up between the Directv DVR and the Tivo.  The Directv DVR was very intuitive and easy to use and had 6 tuners.  The Tivo has the Amazon app and 4 tuners.  The fact that it has the Amazon app and it is so easy to watch Amazon Prime videos, makes up for the less tuners and less intuitive system.  Ov",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"January 23, 2016","Just awesome	I've owned the Bolt for about 3 weeks now, and have added 2 Minis, one at a time, since.  It was a somewhat rocky road getting all of the devices configured - especially the Minis, but it was worth it.  The user experience, compared to the FIOS, is like fast forwarding 10 years into the future.  Just the ability to block stations you never want to see again is awesome.  It's fast, intuitive, and fun.  About half the shows I've recorded respond to the ""Skip"" button on the remote, which skips all commercials perfectly.  Wow!  I'm not sure why, but the picture and especially the sound quality has greatly improved.  Most everything is Dolby Digital now - it wasn't before.  And I love not paying $50 at month for the big clunky FIOS boxes and those awful remotes.  In about 12 months, I'll hit the break even for all of the Tivo equipment, and at that point will just be paying $15 a month to Tivo for their service, and whatever FIOS gets for a single cable card, which is all you'll need for your entire TIVO network.Most of my setup difficulties came from Tivo's assumption that if you are a FIOS customer, you are already MOCA enabled.  I wasn't, and caused a lot of headaches.  There's an easy way to tell - if your FIOS router has an ethernet connection coming in, you're not MOCA enabled.  FIOS can set that up for you remotely.  Once you are, makes sure there's no ethernet cable connected to your Bolt - as internet connectivity will also be coming in through the coax cable.  If there is, the Bolt will work fine, but the Minis won't.Tivo rocks!",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

This is wonderful.  I also don't have to pay the $15.00 a month maintenance fee (for 12 months).  This is a savings of $180.00 and reduces the $299.00 price of the TiVo Bolt to $119.00.

I love the ease and smoothness of the TiVo Bolt. QuickMode takes a little getting used to, but now I use it quite often. I love the SkipMode!!!  That's the way TV viewing should be. To put the icing on the cake, the Bolt is 4K UHD compatible (unlike Apple TV) so 4K programs look GREAT on my new 4K TV...

I like the ability to see all the episodes of shows even if they arent recorded and find where to watch them, but the interface to me still seems a little clunky and hard to manage.  We have been recording OTA through Windows Media Center for years, and while that has worked fairly well this has still been so nice and easy to come back to.  The android app works great and lets us watch our shows all around the house.  The iphone app works fine for most things, but it keeps thinking they arent connected when they are on the same wifi. I am a little disappointed just how many shows will not let you download episodes due to copyright, and since the stream feature outside the house still doesn't work with the Bolt (but every other box) we cant take our shows to go.  Downloading some spare disney shows for our little daughter is a big deal to us and our sanity lol. Even when you can download the process takes forever and it seems like you have to leave the app on the download page or it stops the process.

I had gotten used to my former TiVo Premiere but was frustrated with its speed and the dual recording streams. The Bolt blows it away in speed, and with the ability to record up to four things at once, I am no longer left trying to decide which show I want to drop on those nights of the week when several different channels show their best show.Added to this are two of my favorite features. The speed of the Bolt is amazing. It used to take as much as two minutes to connect and log into Netflix from my Premiere. With the Bolt this seems nearly instant.

"March 6, 2016","So much better than Comcast DVR	I never understood why someone would pay so much for a Tivo box when the cable provider offers a DVR box (for a price...more on that later).  Then I got this Bolt and it is a night and day difference from the terrible Comcast DVR box.  The user interface is much easier to navigate and the channel guide is head and shoulders above the Comcast guide.There are so many features on the Bolt that are better than the Comcast DVR. The one that I appreciate the most is the ""Skip"" button.  Being able to completely and effortlessly skip commercials in recorded TV shows in invaluable.  This feature alone is worth the price of admission.Another feature that I love is the integration of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.  For the first time since we have been subscribing to Netflix and Amazon Prime are we actually getting our money's worth.  We have a smart TV and an smart BR player with Netflix and Amazon apps but it was way too cumbersome and the apps were hard to navigate.  The Bolt  makes watching Netflix and Amazon so simple and we are watching much much more from Netflix and Amazon.Another feature that I love is the iOS/Android Tivo app that lets you watch live/recorded TV on your smartphone/tablet.  You can stream the show on your home network or download the show for viewing outside your home.  The Bolt does not have the capability to stream to an external network, yet.The last ""feature"" that I appreciate is the cost savings.  We were renting a DVR and two set top boxes from Comcast for about $40/month.  I turned in all of those boxes and replaced them with a Bolt, Tivo Mini, and a Google Chromecast.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"December 7, 2015","Leader of the Pack!	So far, we love it! SkipMode is our favorite feature. The fact that we can go from OTA channels to the streaming channels with one remote and one device is worth the cost. Tried other DVRs and found that the tuners in the TiVo are so much more stable and hold the OTA channels much better. The only negative thing I have experienced so far is when I dial in an OTA channel like 8 for example, it goes to 8-0 (I guess) where there is no station. I then have to channel up one to get to 8-1 since there is no dash key on the remote to type in. So you can't go directly to an OTA channel unless you do it via the guide. I would also ding TiVo for not having HULU as a menu option with the other streaming channels but I have been promised by tech support that it's coming soon. Make good on your promise TiVo! The lack of a HULU option is the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars.UPDATE:  12/08/2015 - I have been corrected on the ""dash"" issue.  Apparently there is a ""dash"" button on the remote I was not aware of.  Apparently it is the small button above the colored green button so I've been told.  Will have to check this out when I get home tonight.  Thanks!UPDATE:  12/16/2015 - Just 10 minutes ago I hit the TiVo button just for no reason but to scoot around the menus to check if there had been any updates to services and such.  At first I was sad to see still only Netflix and Amazon Prime...THEN...right before my eyes, HULU popped into the list...as I was looking at the screen!

"November 14, 2015","The Best Set Top Box Available Today!	I've owned the TIVO BOLT 500GB model for about a month now. Hands down, it is the best (and dare I say, most underrated) set top box I have ever come across. The magic of the BOLT is that it is built for the future of streaming media as well as traditional cable television. For people like me who don't want to spend all their time hunting for content to watch, or aren't ready to cut the cord, his is the product to have. OneSearch and OnePass make it so easy to find and record what you want to watch; you literally set it and forget it. SkipMode on recorded shows is awesome and saves you time, although QuickMode should really be used for shows where dialogue isn't as important (the audio is clear but I still tend to miss things). TIVO suggestions and the box sets allow me to discover new content that I didn't know existed, and the ability to stream shows to my phone or record via TIVO online is great. The price is also fantastic too - $299 is well worth it, given that you get the first year of service free and the continual warranty. Did I mention that I'm saving $60 a year vs. my cable provider's box? Simply put, you need to try this product. It will change the way you watch TV.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"February 9, 2016","Love the Bolt!	I was pleasantly surprised how well this new unit works.  Much better than expected.  It appears to get as good or possibly better reception than my Sony 2014 TV gets.  I am using it in my RV after noting that my Directv Satellite only connects to channels I seldom watch.  Since I installed the Bolt, I have not gone back to the Satellite but once.  I get all my standard TV Stations via my RV powered antenna.  The recordings are great and the SKIP button amazing.  FF and Skip are nearly instant when using the RF Remote unlike my Directv Genie which has about a 2 second delay for everything.I am beginning to believe that cord cutting is the way to go.  This will save me over $100/month in fees and yet give me 95-98% of all the channels I care to watch.I connected my Netflix and Prime to the TiVo Bolt and noted that TiVo will actually show you which sources can provide the show you are looking for and play or record it.  Very intuitive and very fast.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"May 16, 2016","Well worth the investment!!	We've had this unit for a little over 2 months and it is an amazing system.  It took over 3 months to do my research and after finally knowing what I wanted and what the bolt is capable of giving I pulled the trigger and purchased right from the TiVo website.  We are now in full support of TiVo. I opted for the OTA which I installed inside my attic with a 65 mile range even though we are only 30 miles from tower. There are absolutely no pixilation issues at all and with the uncompressed HD signal quality by using OTA it is like night and day between dish, directv and cable companies which have a compressed HD signal. The recording features are impressive and the remote control is extremely responsive. We also have Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime ( which I will also say that all 3 have their own original shows now and is impressive as well ), Pandora and iheart radio. The icing on the cake for me is PLEX, by using my network attached storage with all of our dvd movies and bluray movies and music I'm able  to stream everything through the Bolt. Setup was pretty straight forward as I also opted to connect the Bolt via WIFI.  Take note however, if you connect your mini's do so through Moca and not wireless it's pretty easy just read the directions. It is really nice to not have to switch inputs on our television anymore. Love the skip mode. I have also already installed a western digital 1tb hard drive to this also for added DVR storage.The industry is in fact changing also, everyday to be exact.

"February 3, 2016","I love the TiVo Bolt recording	When I first 'cut the cord' I thought I'd have a tough time of it, and I did. But, I started to research what I could do just to be able to tell what was on TV at any given time. I discovered that there were a number of DVR devices on the market. My research led me to decide on getting the TiVo Bolt. Since then, I have not missed 'cable' at all. The only time I may miss it is during football season, but then I discovered that I can subscribe to 'Sling TV' which broadcast both ESPN & ESPN2. So, during football season I'll subscribe to that... I love the TiVo Bolt recording, program schedule along with the many features thereof, the 'skip' feature, etc. I figure that after the first year TiVo subscription, the $149/yr subscription fee beats $100/mo cable fee six ways to Sunday.

"July 28, 2016","Tivo gets a facelift !	I have been a TiVo customer since their launch. However over recent years, my old TiVo HD went on the shelf in favor of my Roku, Fire TV and Apple TV devices. However when the Bolt was launched I thought the concept of unifying my apps with my OTA TV on one HDMI connection to be an interesting one. So I decided to give it a try. It felt like an old friend having the peanut remote back in my hand, although it felt huge after my Apple TV 4 remote !So far it has lived up to expectations. I love the idea that you can add anything from Hulu, Netflix, HBO and Amazon to your watch list. It extends the size of the drive because all streaming services stream direct from the source, bypassing the drive. As for my OTA recordings, I love the commercial skip feature on the main networks. This alone helps justly the annual TiVo fee, because I detest the interruption of commercials !Talking about the fee, I do feel that it's a bit much and logistically with all the competition out there, I would hope to see a change in their pricing structure in the near future.To sum up I think this device brings TiVo bang up to date, with the combination of the old features we were familiar with and some great new ones.All we need now is for the service fee to drop a little and you'll have a near perfect device to meet all your streaming and network needs.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

I started out with the TiVO Series 2 and it changed my life.  Bye-bye VHS tapes! Being able to to catch a chow midstream and back up 30 minutes - amazing.Then, four years later I went to the Series 3 HD dual tuner.  Being able to record two shows at once while watching a third I had already recorded, TiVo did it again.The last couple of years I had thought about getting the Roamio, then I saw that the BOLT came out. As soon as I read about what it can do it was time to say farewell my friend the Series 3.Being able to track and record four HD channels at once, all while watching a TiVo recording or video on demand from my cable provider or Amazon Prime is a remarkable. I love SkipMode which in some, but not all, cases to skip commercials, but what does it for me though is QuickMode.I love watching the NFL, but many times I do not have 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 hours to sit and watch the game. I will record the game and start watching about halfway through using QuickMode. I can watch the full game in 90 minutes or less using this brilliant feature.After reading about the Roamio, I thought TiVo had scored a ""10"" and was ready to buy, but then the BOLT came out and it is just ""that 'much' better"" so that it is ""one louder"" so ""it goes to 11"".Thank you again TiVo for setting the standard by which all other DVRs are judged.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

"March 21, 2016","Worthwhile upgrade to my TiVo Premiere	I have 3 TiVo Premieres, and have been very happy with them. But I just couldn't resist the new QuickMode and SkipMode features on the new Bolt.  I am already spoiled by the commercial skip, and now find myself annoyed when I have to skip the old fashioned way. You get spoiled very quickly. The new  unit is also noticeably faster than my old units. Calling up and scrolling through menus is almost instantaneous, and even connecting to one of my older Premiere units on the network is faster. I don't have any need for the UHD yet, but it is nice to know that it is there for when the time comes.Just a few minor complaints: 1) I could have done without the curved unit. I'm not sure whether that design was due to a venting issue or a desire to physically prevent people from putting something on top  of it, but I would have preferred a flat unit, possibly with some feet if they wanted better venting; 2) I don't particularly like the white, and the white remote is going to get dirty faster; and 3) it definitely gets warmer than my old units, possibly because it is a smaller unit with everything crammed into a smaller space. Hopefully that will not shorten its life.Despite the minor complaints I would wholeheartedly recommend the upgrade to anyone with an older unit. I don't know whether it is faster than the Roamio series, so maybe it's not as big an upgrade if you have one of those. But for Premiere users I think you will be very happy with the upgrade.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

It has a very well Integrated interface with over the air shows, recorded shows, NetFlix shows, and Amazon Prime shows. It has one easy to use interface to see all your TV show options on one screen! On top of this, you can stream any content from your Bolt to your phones or tablets in your home, porch or yard. You can also connect to your TiVo app from your phone or tablet while not home, to remotely set a program to record! Finish that show you were watching at a friends house when you get home! The one button instant skip mode on most recorded shows, is super cool as you get there instantly without fast forward guessing! If I ever need more recording  space I can simply attach an eSATA hard drive. Do not forget to buy a MoCA POE Filter to prevent your Bolt from transmitting your home internet signal via your coax connected antenna. The Bolt turns your connected antenna coax into an MoCA (Multimedia over Coax) allowing the connected coax in your house to be used for antenna or wired internet via the coax. This built in feature allows you to use your house coax to connect a TiVo mini to other rooms in your house that have coax already run and allow full access to your TiVo Bolt programming and features on other TVs via this coax or other wired Ethernet cables.Have fun being fully connec",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

Also love that it replaces both my Verizon DVR and my Roku which saves space.  I hated that my Roku transmitted as a Wifi Access point for its remote to function - so that box is now history!  I look forward to the ability to view my recorded programs remotely, which I believe is a feature that will be coming to the Bolt.  My wishlist for the next generation would be the ability to add a large USB harddrive full of my home movies to play through the Bolt interface.  Also, I don't like that they have a small ad at the bottom of the home screen.  I paid a lot of money for this box, do they really have to do that?

I like several of the Bolt's features including the Skip capability, the ability to remove channels that are not a part of my cable package and the fact that the remote quickly recognized my TV.I also purchased a Mini so I have gotten rid of two cable boxes (and over $40 in rental fees) and get HD programming on multiple sets, DVR capability and improved integration with Netflix and Amazon Prime.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"December 6, 2015","Great Purchase!	We were looking to cut our cable bill which had reached ridiculous levels.  Three DVR's were costing almost $90 a month so we looked for something feature-rich (SkipMode is awesome!) with a great reputation to replace them.  We found that and more in the TiVo Bolt.  We got the Bolt and two mini's and it has been an excellent experience.  Easy to install, the one time I had to talk to tech support was an outstanding experience (unlike tech support at the cable company), and in less than six months the recurring fees I was paying my cable company will offset the one-time purchase I made when I bought the TiVo's.  The savings after that is money in MY pocket, not the cable company's.  I highly recommend the Bolt.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

I got the Tivo after frustration with Microsoft Media Centers lack of support when they changed their guide provider. We could not longer get the tv guide which made recording a huge pain. It took a few days to figure everything out on Tivo but their tech support was quick to get back via email to explain things we weren't understanding.Now that we've got it configured, we like it even better than Media Center (with exception of monthly fees that start next year).Love the skip button for shows that offer it, as well as the 30 sec skip.Love the interface and flexibility of how you record shows.

"November 18, 2015","DVR on steroids!!!	I have only scratched the surface on the features of this bolt. It is my first tivo so I can't compare it to other models.Not only does it get more personalized the more you use , it is made for the next generation of tv resolution with the 4k compatible. Also, I think using this tivo is giving me a better picture on my 1080 tv than it had with the charter cable dvr. The skip mode works pretty good. I like how tivo reminds me to skip if I want.Bottom line is this. If you want to unscramble the 24hrs of cable on 150+ channels to make it your cable guide and watch what you want then this tivo is for you. Sure you can do a lot of these features on the cable company's dvr. The tivo just makes everything easier.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

(And the cost of a second cablecard.)Appreciate that it will work with existing cable or antennas. It's nice to have the option should my needs change.Love the smaller footprint, but I'm not too sure about WHITE! Really.A little disappointed that I wasn't smart enough to realize that SkipMode was for recorded shows only! Silly me. We are so bombarded with advertising these days. Commercials ""OFF"" should be an option for everything! In any case, I love the feature, but don't feel that it's available from enough broadcasters to boast about.Still working on the QuickMode. Haven't used that feature yet.All in all, the value for the up-grade is excellent. Service included for one year makes the Bolt free. Can't go wrong with that, especially since I love TiVo!!",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip
"November 12, 2015","Love it.	I do admit this is my first TiVo other than prior experience with DirecTV which I believe was based on TiVo?? Had the cable company whole home dvr and after months of issues with recordings and watching recorded shows on the non dvr tv and having to reset all the time, I decided to give the 30 day money back guarantee try with TiVo. I have the bolt and a mini and used my current cable set up and just had to set up the local network on the box and everything works perfectly. The only issues I had were with setup and how to properly set up the cable card and tuning adapter for my provider. But since it has been set up, I haven't had to reset anything and everything has worked perfectly.  Also can't beat the monthly savings over cable equipment. No brainer.Favorite features.-skipping commercials with one button is the best thing ever. Everyone that comes over and sees that feature wants it.-quick mode is quite useful and you get used to the speeded up video and audio.

This unit is the KING of time-savers.  It's easy to select shows to record, easy to locate what you want to watch now, and easy to blast through commercials with Skip Mode.  I added a TiVo Mini in a second room, and the most time I spent was sitting at the Time Warner Cable office, waiting to turn in my set top box.  I spent $150 for the Mini, and eliminated $11.25 from my cable bill every month... forever! That is the definition of a no-brainer.  I was concerned that the response might be slow or clunky in the second room, but the user experience is at least 95% of what you are used to in the main room.  You may see an extra one or two second delay here and there, but it's extremely close to the response you get sitting in the room with the BOLT.

"April 11, 2016","Very Impressed With Tivo Bolt	Extremely impressed with TIVO Bolt.  I just switched to FIOS and was worried that the installer would be clueless when it came to anything other than Verizon equipment.  And I was right! His experience was limited to installing a cable card in a Tivo unit two years ago.  Nevertheless, between the two of us we were able to get the CableCard installed and activated in about 30 minutes.Updating the unit and getting it connected to the internet and my streaming services was very fast, easy and intuitive as is operation of the unit.  The box gives you a lot more customization choices than my old X1 DVR but the information is presented in a way that you are not overwhelmed with options.  The skip and quick mode are fantastic as is the ability to search across platforms.  The best part for a former cable company DVR renter like me?  The unit is blazing fast; you press a button and the channel switches instantaneously or the guide pages down quickly.  No more waiting through 1-2 seconds of lag time as your unit catches up.  The same is true with the selection of Amazon or Netflix titles--everything is fast and seamless the way it should be.The icing on the cake is that TIVO pays for itself within months and then some:  the TIVO Bolt and Mini I purchased (which works as well as the Bolt) will save me $45 a month in device rental and DVR fees.Nice work Tivo, keep up the good work and I look forward to future product updates that will allow for out of home streaming and access to FIOS on demand selections.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,Commerical Skip

I have 3 TVs with one DVR.  I wanted to lower my monthly bill significantly  So I've switched from owning 3 FIOS devices to 3 Tivo(1 Bolt and 2 minis).  My calculation is that one year of FIOS device rentals will pay for the complete Tivo cost.  Year 2 and on I only need to pay Tivo a $15 a month fee(this fee is waved by Tivo for 1 year when you by a Bolt) vs the never ending device cost associated with FIOS.  You do need to rent a Multi cast -CableCard from FIOS about $5 a month.So far the only loss is FIOS ondemand.  I mostly get by that feature by using Netflix, Hulu, ... which is built into Tivo.  You can still use FIOS ondemand via other devices(tablet, smartphone, laptop, ...).Everything else is so much better.- Remote devices from the DVR are no longer glitchy.

"October 23, 2015","Almost perfect it just needs a few software tweaks.	I've had the Bolt for about two weeks now and for the most part, I am extremely impressed with TiVo's new model, the Bolt. It is far superior to the stock Ciso unit offered by my cable provider Charter.I thought the price was very reasonable at $299 for 500GB (there is a 1TB option for $100 more where 500GB = 75 HD hours, 1TB = 150 HD). Well worth it, considering they give you one year of service for free which saves me 12 months of cable box and DVR fees.  I did have to go by Charter and get a Cable Card and a Tuner Adapter in order to make the Bolt work. Charter charges $2 a month for that. I read some cable companies offer it for free. To set it up, there was a small quick start guide but be prepared to go to the web site to download the full manual.Commercial Skip mode works perfectly on recorded shows, but is not offered on all networks. It's still a welcome feature. After you record a show, a little green ""Skip"" icon will show up on the show later if Skip is available.  You get to a commercial, press the D button on the remote, and it flawlessly moves to right before the program starts again. It even works midway through the commercials.  I've seen claims it will currently work on about 20 networks which you would think would be the majors, mostly",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip
"December 13, 2015","Like it except for one thing.	One little tweak could have made this perfect.  I recently cancelled my Dish Satellite service.  I've been watching TV from my HDTV Antenna mounted on a 30' mast, and pulling in Amazon and Netflix from the Amazon Fire TV.  I bought the Tivo for two reasons, to be able to record shows from the antenna without having to watch commercials, and to not need the Fire TV.  Don't get me wrong, I love the new 4K Fire TV (even though my TV is only capable of 1080P), but I just thought I would use the Tivo Bolt for everything. I run everything through a Yamaha Receiver, and it just would have made for less switching of inputs.It would have worked except for one thing, controlling Amazon content from the Tivo remote (pause, rewind, fast forward, etc) was a PITA with the Tivo remote.  I much prefer using the dedicated Voice Remote that comes with the Fire TV, it's interface is much more user friendly.All in all, I really like the Bolt. It's worth it to me to spend $149.00 a year to have the ability to record and skip commercials from Broadcast TV.Just wish the remote were a little more user friendly so I could have used it for everything. In my opinion, that's the only thing keeping this from getting 5-stars.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip
"October 28, 2015","The Bolt is AWSOME! It's TV how it's supposed to be.	Love it so far! After all the initial updating (which was a little time consuming) the Bolt has proven to be one of the greatest things I've ever invested my money in. (entertainment-wise) Picked up my cable channels immediately and though I no longer use it the suggested shows feature was very interesting and surprisingly spot-on. Having 4 shows to record at once was a godsend! SO glad to give Comcrap back their terrible, sluggish DVR. Initially I didn't think the SkipMode thing was going to be a big deal because fast forward always worked for me. Never have I been so wrong...OMG! It's one of those things I can't live without now. The integrated apps is simply wonderful. All my app subscriptions right there on the same input as my cable. And they have the Plex app which delivers all my entertainment media stored on my PC right to my TV. Why these TiVo people put Plex under the music menu I have no idea. Someone dropped the ball on that. Anyway...not only does the Bolt record shows like a traditional DVR but it also pulls your shows from streaming services if available. I mean...WOW! Thank you! The Bolt also streams to your mobile devices on your network and recorded shows anywhere you have a decent data connection. It's fantastic.

Antenna comes in and out on some channels but overall very happy.  If truly want to offer cable free option provide a simple limited internet connectivity for the guide........  Love the guide and recommendations.  New this Fall, new comedies, .....Only had about a week. Love ease of use.  Hooked to a $6 antenna and get about 40 stations. The curve design makes placement an issue. It was very easy to install Hulu, prime, YouTube.  The skip function is nice but so many stations dont offer its easy to forget about. Not sure any it allows recording of streamed items.  Maybe that's important if you are interested in connecting to other devices or expect loss of internet.Have to test this out if the internet goes down to see if I can access everything except the guide.Wish the subscription weren't so high.  If they offered movies etc I might understand. Also, not allowing subscriptions to transfer to new devices is horrible.

"March 9, 2016","Very good product	Very nice product but I nearly returned it when it kept freezing up repeatedly.  Neither the technicians from TIVO or Time Warner Cable had a solution that corrected the issue until a TWC technician came to see the set up which was done the way it was said to be done per TWC instructions.  Instead of the coax first going into the digital tuner provided by TWC and then into the Bolt the solution was to put a splitter on the TWC coax, sending one line in to the digital tuner and one in to the Bolt.  After that was all done no more freezing or locking up.  That was something I could have easily done myself but instead it cost me $30 for a repair call.  TWC should have altered their instructions and TIVO should learn of this problem.Apparently the white vertical lines on the time line (when pause is activated) can't be jumped to on the Bolt, so why are they there then?Besides those two issues, the Bolt is a very good product.  I use the QuickMode a lot.  Loading of the streaming sites is quite fast.  Skip mode is great when it's available!I wish the fan was a bit quieter.I wish the time line bar would disappear after two seconds in the pause mode since sometimes I'm trying to read or see some important information in that area.  At least provide a transparency option.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip
"March 1, 2016","It's fantastic - And Easy to Modify for More Storage!	Let me start by saying that I think the Bolt is pricey for the size hard drive you get. Storage is inexpensive and TiVo skimped a bit here.So, I bought a 2GB drive and swapped out the hard drive in the new bolt before turning it back on. TiVO doesn't even sell a 2 GB Bolt, but now I have one!A few things I didn't expect (which I like):+ The resolution is much better than what I had with my cable company DVR. less artifacts, faster channel changes, and smoother fast forward.+ Skip Mode and QuickMode are insanely awesome - you'll wonder how you lived without them+ The system seamlessly integrates with streaming services - the netflix app on the bolt is gorgeous.Sometimes Pandora/Spotify crashes, but I blame those apps, not the Bolt. I wish I could stream outside the home like Slingbox can. That feature is sorely missed. I also wish Tivo Minis were less expensive or that I could use my appleTV like a TiVo mini.I would pay $40 for an app that let me use my appletv box as a TiVo mini. Maybe the remote is the issue?Overall - Highly recommended to anyone new to TiVo. This is a great box at a great price!",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip
"November 18, 2015","Significant Upgrade over TiVo HD, Not Perfect.	I upgraded from the TiVo HD from 2008. It's a HUGE upgrade. The OS refresh was much needed, and is significantly faster to browse than the older version.  Skip mode is a nice addition, though it's not always available, sometimes even on very popular shows (and certainly not for at least a few hours after broadcast). I get a surprising amount of use out of QuickMode . It's a great way to get through a backlog quickly.While I don't particularly mind the strange new curved look, functionally it's awkward. I used to have a digital clock on top of my TiVo. Now it has to go to the side. It's not a big deal, but it's strange.I've had the unit for just over a month, and have had one solitary issue of the OS freezing. It seems pretty stable, but when it happened two days into our relationship, I was quite frustrated. A reboot fixed the problem and it hasn't popped up since. Hopefully it was a one-time thing.UPDATE: The fan on the TiVo Bolt is quite loud -- if you plan on purchasing this device for a bedroom, you may want to reconsider.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip

I have noticed some frame skip from time to time,  and there are intermittent audio problems including delay and extraneous noise. Both of the audio problems disappear when the channel is changed. Overall, I am very satisfied with the unit. I have not as yet contacted tech support concerning the issues I have mentioned. Hopefully, there is a fix.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip

Better than any other DVR service.With that being said, below are a few of the negatives that we identified.  Some of it can be fixed with software/firmware updates.- Equipment is a little expensive, but  it is acceptable considering money saved dropping tv services.  However, the service fees are expensive.  Especially, considering we dropped tv services due to expensive service fees & poor service.  TiVo currently offers life of the device for $600. If that was lifetime service, I would pay it right now & be a TiVo customer for life.  Or they could lower their annual fee to at least $100.- Also, the necessity to hardline an Ethernet cable to the TiVo mini is a design flaw.  This restricts where you can put your TV & the TiVo mini.  It should work via wifi.- One major feature that is missing is DLNA functions. It has Plex, but we have a WD Cloud & can stream our content to TV without Plex. It would be nice to tap into our own content without having to switch remotes.- TiVo is missing a couple of key apps. For example, ESPN & Disney apps. Again, we have to switch devices to get access.We are very happy with the TiVo Bolt. We are only outlining some of the ne",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip

I took off one star for the Tivo interface - there are many things they could do better (exclusion terms for wishlist searches, for example).  The average user will probably never have a problem with the interface - and it does offer a lot more than my old Series 3 Tivo - but many of the menu options are still lacking flexibility.  For example, the ""Suggestions"" recorded about 25 ""financial news"" shows over the past week.  No idea why, and no way to make it not record them.  The simple solution is to add an option to exclude a category (like ""News"" or ""Paid Programming) from Suggestions.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip

Skips whole commercials and has great TiVo ergonomics which are superior to Comcast's cable box and their new Xfinity box. Four shows can show at once and easy to flip from one to another.

Four tuners all live at once is GREAT for football. Compared to my old TiVo3, it has less bulk.Regarding the 30-second advance button: I would prefer to jump the time rather than hi-speed the time, or have the option to switch between jump and hi-speed. Otherwise, great for football to skip to the next snap without watching too many replays and the always-exciting huddle.I couldn't use my old USB-to-WiFi from my TiVo3!

"October 21, 2015","It's a Tivo box and it absolutely requires a cable card	I've used the TIVO Bolt for a few weeks now and am updating my review.  I've increased the start to 4 because I really do like the automatic skip the commercial feature when it works.  Never actually realized how much time is taken up by commercials until I saw the minute count move each time the skip feature works.  There are still issues:  I haven't been able to get the premium channels or On Demand by Comcast.  Tivo says this is a Comcast issue.  Also, the skip feature doesn't work on all the prime time shows and oddly works on the same show sometimes and then isn't available for the same series recorded on a different day.The streaming content function is OK but no better than the function available on samsung smart TV or apple TV.  Plus it's a little annoying when you set up recordings because it will list every version available of a program including streaming video which you may actually have to pay for.  I guess that's an attractive feature for people that have done away with cable or satellite and just want to record or see what's available that they can purchase on a streaming site.  You have to remember to select new only and no streaming when setting up recordings if you don't want all those options.My 7 year old TIVO gave up the ghost ov",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,Commerical Skip
"November 12, 2015","An Honest Opinion	I migrated from a Roamio OTA 4- tuner to the Bolt for one reason. That was the Commercial Skip feature. The information provided by TIVO concerning the parameters as to which programs would be targeted was very misleading (I understood shows from the top 20 networks between 4 pm thru midnight to cover the late night shows). I still do not know what is covered but I did get a response to one of my surveys which stated that just because a show was marked SKIP once does not mean that each current episode would be so marked. This is disappointing and deceptive. Concerning those shows that do get tagged, the feature works very well 99% of the time. Some are dead on, some are off by a second or two. A few times the beginning SKIP is omitted but I know once the commercial starts to hit the CHANNEL FORWARD (this is by far a better choice than the D button for this elderly old fellow). So I am 85% happy with the feature and hope that the number of shows are increased. Even though I am still paying for my subscription on the Roamio (I knew that I would be), I genuinely feel that the move was very worthwhile. Even though I have a 4K Smart TV and can get to Netflix directly to view those such movies in 4K, the Netflix app on the TIVO offers the same. Hence, one less remote to mess with.

It's available on ~10% of my shows.- There are now only two lights on the front of the box.  The problem with this is that you can no longer see how many tuners are actively recording by looking at the front panel.-  Cannot cooperatively record with other TiVo boxes (explanation below)What I mean by cooperatively record: I own a TiVo Premiere XL4 with four tuners, and I have recently added a TiVo Bolt, which also has 4 tuners.  This should mean that I have 8 tuners capable of recording - in tandem - with the same OnePass.  There are times when 7 football matches are available to record, creating conflicts and causing the tuners to not record three of them... what should happen is that the tuners on the second box should take over the remaining recordings.  The libraries of two home-networked TiVo boxes should be compiled and displayed as a single library.

Commercial skip on late night channels only really needs to expand to the other channels. Search across different sources like Netflix and cable is great too. However, the lack of apps like HBO Now makes this limited. The box also needs to be able to accommodate OTA and Cable, not one or the other. I had gotten used to watching local channels OTA because OTA picture quality is a significant improvement over the HD cable signal (I'm guessing it's their horrible compression that degrades cable picture quality). However, I'm still stuck in the situation of swapping inputs for watching OTA and Cable with the Bolt - this also means the unified search feature cannot include both sources either. That is disappointing. The remote commands transferred to my Harmony One perfectly. However, the TiVo remote seems to be missing Page Up and Page Down on the channel guide.

The service subscription ends when the unit dies and cannot be transferred to another unit - so you have to either fix the unit you have or start all over again.

More and more cable tv shows now are extending the show's run time by an extra two to five minutes, overlapping into times of shows on other channels.  This was almost never a big deal with six tuners, but with only four, recordings are more likely to get chopped off or missed entirely.The new Bolt skip-forward feature is very underwhelming.  It's only available on select shows and times each day, and even then there's sometimes a delay after the show finishes before the skip updates are added to the recordings.The new Bolt box shape and color is unattractive and also makes it difficult to stack with other entertainment center equipment because nothing can sit on top of it any more. I also really miss the lights on the front that showed not just when at least one show was recording but how many shows, as the Roamio did. There's now just one recording light with the Bolt. Also on the Roamio boxes when you were transferring a show from another box or device there was a blue light that indicated the transfer in progress.
