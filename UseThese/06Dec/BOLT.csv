I am not paying $28 per month to Verizon for using outdated DVR technology (1 DVR, 1 extra box) - now I am only paying Verizon $5 monthly fee for renting a CableCard in addition to programming fees.2. Amazing picture quality. It certainly seems that my TV signal quality (I have a five year old high-end 1080p Sony Bravia TV) improved dramatically.3. TiVo Bolt is way faster and has a materially better UI than my old FiOS DVR.4. I can record four shows simultaneously at the same time v. two using FiOS boxes. Recording options are way more advanced on TiVo and greatly improve the overall experience.5. Ability to search for your desired content, be it shows, movies or whatever else across all of your services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, inter alia) is revolutionary. To that extend, I highly recommend getting a TiVo Slide Pro Remote which has a sensor-activated backlit keyboard and a Search button.6. TiVo Mini works extremely well and has no monthly fees whatsoever7. QuickMode works well but it takes time getting used to.8. The device itself is small, sleek and sexy.9. TiVO recording can be pulled up using Amazon Fire / Amazon Fire Stick allowing kids to watch recorded shows on secondary TVs (however see below)10. I now have three times (3x) more space to play with on my DVR.So-so:1. Skip Mode, which fully skips commercials with a click of a button is incredible when it is available.

20-04-2016,"Best STB/DVR for Supported Cable Systems	TiVo as the superior Set Top Box/DVR option:I've had plenty of STB/DVR boxes from the likes of Motorola and Atlanta Scientific over the years and they ranged from bad to awful. Big, clunky, and feature-limited boxes with horrid program guides. Technology has marched on and these beasts had hardly advanced in 20 years. The X1 platform is the first significant improvement, but follows the same tired and user-hostile recipe- including monthly rental charges for the box. I recently lived in an area where the local cable company gave up on the proprietary boxes and issued their customers TiVos (Premiere model) instead. Prior to this, I had no experience with or interest in having a TiVo. I was a total convert. Then I moved back to a Comcast location and totally missed the TiVo. So I did some research and bought the 500GB TiVo Bolt. Now there are plenty of cost-breakdown analyses out there and you will save money in the long run, but I'm not going to focus on that here. Getting the CableCard from Comcast was painless, other than having to go to one of their storefronts and take a number and wait. Also painless was the setup- call their special number for CableCard setups- 877-405-2298, otherwise, you will endure pain (you have been warned).What usually turns people away from TiVo is that the box is essentially useless without subscribing to TiVo Service. It's not an insignificant cost and needs to be factored into your decision. The Bolt (at time of writing) includes the first year of service, but is then $15/mo or $150/year or $600 for the lifetime of the Bolt device. So you have the",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"September 25, 2016","Stop renting your DVR and paying taxes every month. This works great and is fun to use!	We decided to reduce our cable bill has much as possible by buying our own equipment last year. We selected the TiVo Bolt because it was 4K compatible and because the guide and search features across all the platforms we use, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, was included. We've had it almost a year and I couldn't be happier. It's very intuitive to use and I love accessing my DVR in the bedroom using my Galaxy and headphones at night with the TiVo app.The ability to skip commercials with many recorded shows and to increase the play back speed without decreasing sound legibility on programs like Antiques Roadshow is a great timesaver (and I don't fall asleep watching slow talking shows as much anymore). Occasionally, the unit will stop functioning, but his is usually after one of our too frequent Florida power outages. After contacting customer service, which was a good experience, I learned to just re-boot, the answer to most of life's electronic problems, and was back on line quickly. After 10 months, the unit paid for itself in DVR rental fees. I pay about $5.00 a month for a cable card, but that's nothing compared to $25.00 plus taxes on a unit that's not nearly as powerful and fun to use at the Bolt.We didn't buy the lifetime service for the guide because I was a bit nervous not knowing how long our box would last. I will probably kick myself if we're paying a guide fee that will start this November for two years, because that's the pay off point. By then, though, I may be tempted to get the latest and greatest new Bolt.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"September 2, 2016","Worth it for skip feature alone!	My TiVo was about nine years old, and we had it on an older TV set. When we finally updated to a HD TV my old TiVo couldn't handle 1080p, and if a show isn't on the TiVo we're pretty much just not going to watch. I was hesitant to update the TiVo because my goal is to get rid of cable eventually, but I'm glad I did. I know there may have been good TiVos after my old one, but I think this one is the only one with skip capability and I LOVE IT. If I show doesn't have skip I get irritated that I have to manually fast forward through the commercials. And the upgrade of how many shows we can record at the same time is helpful. We don't keep movies etc on the TiVo so we didn't need the higher capacity and we find there is enough storage for what we need, just a few shows a week that we delete as we watch. If you like to keep shows and movies too re-watch it would be worth it to get the higher capacity.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"March 7, 2017","Love Love Love this device	Love Love Love this device.  I can ""cut the chord"" and record (and pre-set recordings) for all HD broadcast shows.  Especially handy during college football and basketball seasons.  Never miss a game (especially since Sling rarely has any games in replay!).  Easy to use user interface.  Easy set up (I mean VERY easy).  I set my entire TIVO box in about 30 minutes including ""cycling"" times and connecting HD OTA antenna.  Great multi-functional remote that takes over TV, live streaming, and OTA broadcast functionality (except if you have Sling which requires ROKU etc).  If you are thinking of cutting the chord and minimize streaming services/costs AND you don't want to wait until Hulu posts a certain show (or doesn't at all like ""Quantico"" that has to record OTA or with a special subscription to a cable company affiliated with ABC!!) then this is a GREAT option to ""cut the chord"" with cable companies and allow you to only subscribe/purchase the minimum streaming services to get exclusive stuff like ESPN and Fox. With the TIVO Bolt, I've cut my cable costs by about 70% --- currently have Sling $20 (for ESPN mainly-- requires a ROKU stick that you can get for free from Sling), HULU w/ Showtime add-on and commercial free option $21, Netflix for certain Netflix only shows $8.  My Amazon Prime membership I have for my purchases includes Amazon video so it's a ""sunk cost"" so I don't really include it as a ""streaming cost"" since I'd have Amazon regardless of what comes with it.

"April 10, 2016","Excellent Alternative to Time Warner Cable's DVR and Guide	Rarely, do I find a mix of technology and support that is worth a 5-star rating.  However, after only a week of having one, the Tivo BOLT (and an accompanying Mini) have made the list.There's a lot of talk about ""cutting the cord"" with content providers, and we did that for about a week.  While the ""cord"" remained partially connected (for Internet access), we dropped all TV content opting for the chance to dive head-strong into antennas.  Quickly, we found ourselves futzing with antenna direction, getting one that would rotate, and finally giving up after visions of the 1950's dad holding bunny ears just right to see The Ed Sullivan show.  While the off-the-air broadcasts of local channels works, it's just not reliable. Reception suffered from pixelation, broken frames, and jittery picture from even the strongest signals which were also seriously affected by wind and storms.  Our location may not have been the best without hoisting a 50' antenna (which I wasn't willing to do).However, partially adding-back content with the use of a CableCARD has effectively allowed us to get the local channels and some that we were used to watching, while cutting our monthly costs significantly:  renting two DVRs ($12.99ea), the DVR fee for each ($8.50), the ""Guide"" fee ($3.25x2 -- what?  shouldn't this have been free with the service?), taxes and surcharges (what??) totaling over $16/month; and you get the picture.  The Tivo pays for itself quickly, and factoring in the annual fee (first year's free) ends up cancelling out renting one DVR (and, forget those other cable company",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"April 6, 2016","Let's be honest...	Let's be honest -- TiVo isn't for everyone, but it IS for me and my family.  There are certainly less expensive options, particularly if you're a cord cutter. However, if you are like me, and have wife that watches Discovery ID (or some other cable channel) AND Netflix constantly and has ZERO tolerance for input switching or other ""technical BS"" -- this is the best option.  TiVo just works with everything, and seamlessly integrates cable with online options.  It's also pricey.. but if you're stuck with cable like I am, you may already be paying a stupidly high cable bill.  At that point, just suck it up and buy the stupid thing... you'll be happier for it. Worst part?

It did take a while... the Premiere model was slow.  The Roamio was (and is) a great option... but the Bolt fixes what was left.

It's not all perfect.. like a lot of technology there are some quirks.  I did have an issue with audio dropouts along with my Sony TV and Sonos Playbar.  I do think it was an issue with the Sony, because when I plugged the optical direct from the TiVo to the Playbar the problem went away...

"February 7, 2016","A bit of a pain to set up, a dream once you do!	I had DirecTV for years, and I loved it- the only thing was the price of programming in addition to cable prices started to really add up. I went down to basic cable with Charter.  I found it unusable after all of my years with satellite. The OS of the HD cable box was so dang UGLY and doing everything (On demand, guide, etc) was such an absolute chore.  I knew I needed something new.  I had Tivo back in the day when they were in business with DIrecTV, and I decided to give it a shot.  I read some of the reviews how things were so difficult in dealing with the cable company and the antiquated, dreaded cable card! Let me tell you- it was a bit of a chore. Getting the card was east enough, but you need to have an adapter (provided by Charter) in addition to getting the card. You will need another coax cable to run from the adapter to the TIvo box.  They did not give me one at the cable company, so be aware.  The software of the Tivo did get hung up at 72% while it was downloading the information from the cable- it seems like this was something that has happened to many people.  I called the cable company again and had them unpair and pair the cable card again.  After a bit, it worked, and it's a dream. It does take 1-2 hours to get it all set up.  Be patient, and know that once everything gets put together from the cable company side, it works like a charm.

This keeps your antenna, various streams, YouTube and even Pandora all off one easy to surf menu. The OnePass options to have a permanent constantly renewing list by genre, TV Show, actor, etc, is just one of many functions that has come standard with Tivos that others are still slow to catch on to, and the new function of commercial skip (where applicable) does what it says it does...jump the entire commercial break with a press of a button and back to the show.The only new function I can't speak to is the Fast Play, which is not an option I would choose to turn on, but for binge watchers I could see how something like that would be useful.

I bought this box with 1 year free service and I will purchase a Mini to PR with it which brings my bill down to nothing for 1 year as I will disconnect both of my other TiVo boxes with a savings of about 30 per month and 360 per yr.

I went to Comcast and picked up a cable card and went home on popped it in the Bolt, called Comcast to activate the card, while on the phone with them I was on TiVo's site activating the Bolt, about 30 min later without any issues I was up and running.......WOW  that made my day.. thanks TiVo and Comcast for getting this process all dialed in.I have not had much time to play with the box but from what I can see it looks great, I like the channel labels and it is quick, much faster than my other TiVo Boxes.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

Want to watch the live Sports game?  Bam, ok you're done.  Want to watch something from Netflix or Amazon Video?, you no longer have to switch inputs or mess around with another piece of hardware like a Roku or AppleTV.  The Tivo Bolt lets you watch shows from Netflix, Amazon and others just as easy as if you were going to a Live TV station.It's a game changer device IMO.  Combine the Bolt with Mini's around the home and you now have a unified media network that will stream LiveTV, RecordedTV around the house and also play stuff from the best streaming services.So much better than having to deal with the punitive pricing structure of Cable and Satellite providers who punish their subscribers for using multiple TV's.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

I have this Tivo Bolt in my main living room and 4 Tivo Mini's throughout the house. I still have Fios but now I have all the movie channels and dropped to a ""Custom TV and Sports"" package since I never watched all those channels anyway. I immediately started saving about $100 a month on equipment alone and dropping the package to this new one also saved. My cable bill is down to $130 a month with all movie channels! There are complications, there's no on demand so Cinemax, Showtime and Starz are not listed on the Tivo (HBO is), same with local channels but I have an Apple TV and an Amazon Fire TV so between the three, I can use and watch the on demand stuff with the exception of channel 7's on demand, you have to pay for it for some reason. The other's make you sign in with the Fios account and they work. I can even stream them from my phone flawlessly. I also love the Tivo suggestions!

I had no issues with installation or activation of any services (I have FiOS). My HD and premium stations all work perfectly. The Bolt itself is small and lightweight; considerably smaller than my old STB.It did take a little while to activate but once complete and fully updated, the system is running well. I'm not a hardcore DVR person by any means whatsoever - I just wanted some recording capability and a better interface than the typical Verizon STB and this thing blows it out of the water. There are few apps at the moment but I fully expect this to change in the future. I believe Tivo has a lot in store for the Bolt. Amazon Prime and Netflix work great and integration with the iPhone also works well. 500GB is relatively small for a DVR, but expandable storage is doable via eSata. For me personally, this is a non-issue. Despite the 4K, I don't think this level of storage and 2 fewer tuners are enough for the hardcore DVR users out there, but for those simply wanting a better experience than their cable providers STB, this is a solid way to go.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

We mostly upgraded because we got a free year of service when we purchased, which meant that we could upgrade our Tivo for just $120 if you considered that we were paying $15 a month for service anyways.  And after 6 years we figured a new Tivo for $120 was probably a smart idea in the long run.4. Still works with an Expandable Hard Drive, so we bought the smaller Tivo and transferred our Expandable Hard Drive from the Premiere to the Bolt and it's still compatible.  However we did watch and delete all programming off of it before moving it, Tivo says you can transfer programming in theory, but we couldn't ever get it to work.Things We don't love:1.  You know that spiny wheel that comes up during prime time when too many people are on the internet & Tivo's servers, it's not a software thing with your old Tivo, it still happens with the Bolt, don't buy the Bolt because you think it'll be faster to load, it's just as slow as any other.2.

After reading about its functionality I thought to myself I ""need this feature!""  I despise commercials, especially when most times they are repeated over and over during the same show.  Also, the prescription drug commercials during prime time are on the top of my list for annoying as well.I will be the first to admit that I love my gadgets so to justify this purchase was simply the mathematics.  Since I cancelled cable which resulted in approximately a $50 a month savings. The Tivo Bolt service is $15 a month. Since the current special includes a year of service the net cost equates to a little over $55 bucks for the device. Not bad at all!My Tivo Bolt arrived yesterday and the setup was very easy. It took close to an hour but the majority of that time was downloading and installing updates. The channel scanner located all of my network channels and I was ready to go with no issues or errors.Things I like:1.  Commercial Skip is the best. I feel so empowered when I use it. A victory if you will.2.  I like the one stop shopping for video and entertainment. No more switching input sources, hdmi 1, hdmi 2, etc. to use another source for streaming or subscriptions. Pretty much all",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"December 20, 2015","Pleased with the product	Once this is set up and activated, this functions extremely well. The instructions for first time use are minimal, and that can cause delays in getting it operating. For future buyers, please note: 1) Insert cable card, then connect to your cable outlet. After a few minutes, it will start it's own activation process, which is NOT the cable card activation process. 2) After the Bolt setup is complete, you'll need to navigate to CableCard menu screen, and have the information from that screen handy. 3) Call your provider (in my case, Comcast) and give them the card ID #, the Host ID #, and the Data #. Once that is activated, you'll be very pleased with the Bolt's performance and graphic interface, which is a huge improvement over Comcast/Xfinity. Unfortunately, the Tivo Mini that I also ordered was disappointing, due to it's need for 1990's wired technology. I'll write a separate review about that.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"February 25, 2016","First TiVo and loving every aspect of it!	Due to increasing cable costs, I've been trying find ways to cut my bill. For awhile I've been considering getting a TiVo. This would allow me to ditch my cable companies dvr box and dvr service. When I heard about the TiVo Bolt I decided it was time. I've had the TiVo for a week and so far I love this thing. Far more options than I had with my cable supplied dvr box. The TiVo programming and recording is pretty simple. For those considering making the switch you'll find that the TiVo has everything you get from your cable company box, plus a whole lot more. For me the perks are the commercial skip, although not available on every show, it's available on many of the shows I record. Also the QuickPlay feature is good for watching shows that you may have stockpiled. Bing watch in less time. Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, and more are all easily accessible. As well as Spotify (although you need a full membership to access it), I Heart Radio and On Demand (depending on your cable provider). Now, the down side. I set mine up a week ago, it's taken that week to access everything. I had the cable card (required to get your cable channels) I had a wireless connection (required to access the TiVo guide and features). But I couldn't get everything to talk to one another. My first problem was getting the MAC address to talk to my router. My set up requires me to enter the MAC address for whatever I connect wirelessly. However you need to do a software upgrade as soon as you start the TiVo. Not possible if you can't connect wirelessly. I needed to connect thru my Ethernet, then could find",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"November 18, 2015","TiVo keeps getting better and better.	I upgraded from a TiVo HD to the TiVo Bolt.The new TiVo Bolt works great with Comcast XFINITY cable TV and the other internet video services I use (like Netflix, Amazon Video and YouTube).I like the speed of the new TiVo. The new user interface, while taking a few days to get used to, is really an improvement.  The new remote control is great (and not having to point it at the TiVo is wonderful!)  The iPhone app works pretty much flawlessly for scheduling and viewing recorded content (and I can use my iPhone as a remote control if I can't find the remote!)  The commercial skip is really effective on the shows that support it.  Configuration with the Comcast cable system was time consuming but straightforward and we experienced no issues there.  There was a little hiccup when I tried connecting the Extender Drive from our old TiVo, but a new cable fixed that and we are up and running with 1.5TB of storage.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"April 9, 2016","Great system that pays for itself.	[Edit 7/16/2016 at end of original]I know Tivo has a reputation for a superb user experience, but it wasn't that that drew me the system.  It was the savings of owning vs renting.  I save $10 a month owning the Bolt & Mini along with the cable card rental fee.  The system pays for itself in under 2 years, and I get the premium UI experience of the Tivo to boot.The Bolt integrates TV & online streaming with a focus on shows.  Favor a TV show, and Bolt will make the seasons available to you across live, recorded, and streaming services. Once you learn to trust it, it's wonderful - you focus on the show, and the Bolt does all the work to assemble the show's seasons for you.Glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought the set up was a bit more of pain than it should have been.  The fault isn't with the equipment - it's the activation process that could have been more verbose to let you know how it was progressing.  The process takes an hour, so set your expectations accordingly.Overall, the Bolt is a great system.  You focus on content, and Bolt does the legwork to find it - all the while saving you money over renting equipment from the cable company.  Recommended.[Edit: Addendum]  One niggle to point out - the YouTube & Hulu apps are a tad buggy, though they seem to be getting better over time.  Youtube use to occasionally error in the middle of videos, but now just quits suddenly after prolonged use.  Hulu can freeze after delivering its commercials.  These problems are deal-killers, but they can be annoying.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"February 14, 2016","Extremely fast, great user interface, awesome Amazon Prime and Netflix integration, cheaper than cable DVR.	I've been very impressed with the Bolt so far. Extremely fast and highly usable. Aside being a top notch DVR, I also love the integration with Amazon Prime and Netflix as well. I've upgraded from FIOS DVR to Xfinity cable-card and it is saving me money over their rental unit, less boxes and cables next to my TV, lower power consumption, and just a significantly better DVR. So far a win, win, win.Not many downsides for me.  Some UI stumbles but it is probably more with my learning the remote rather than a problem with the Tivo.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

Finally had the opportunity recently to become part of the family again when I moved to an area that was serviced by Comcast.  It's great to be back.  Interface is simple and intuitive and it's also great to have access to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. from the Tivo menu.  (Now if they could just figure out a way to integrate HBONow.)  After some confusion, I was delighted to discover that the ability to set up a MoCa network was built into the Bolt so adding a Tivo Mini in another room was quick and simple.  Pairing with one of Comcast's cablecards was a bit of an ordeal but, after a few misfires, everything is running smooth.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

The interface is even better and more intuitive than before.  I wish I had made the switch immediately after the release.The Skip Mode is nice, but so rare for what I watch, it's not a huge selling point.  Also, I don't find the One Pass terribly helpful add I don't subscribe to Hulu and it links to Paid Amazon content rather than Prime...So I find it a bit annoying I can't have it recognize what is substitution based vs what I already pay for.  Obviously this is easy to ignite with the click of a button.Swapping cable cards was a snap and quickly recognized.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"April 30, 2016","""Aspect Correction Mode"" seals the deal!	My interest was in the terrestrial ""Over The Air"" capabilities of this tuner. What tickeled my ear was the ""Aspect Correction Mode"" feature. My internal OTA tuner on my TV would constantly default to ""stretch-o-vision"" when it came to sources originally filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio. I found myself constantly accessing a menu for correction. The Tivo was not my first choice and initially purchased a tuner that needed a software upgrade just to make it compatible with my new 4K TV, defaulting to, you guessed it, ""stretch-o-vision"". Again, constantly having to adjust aspect ratio. What a delight not having to deal with this issue with my new 4K Tivo Bolt.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"January 7, 2016","Love my new TiVo	First, I must say, I love this Tivo box.  That said, here's what I would like enhanced and fixed.1.  It needs more tuners.  I have two minis and I find that sometimes I have to put one in standby to watch live tv on the other.2.  The bolt cannot keep up with the required 30 sec skips all the time and gets locked from further skips.3.  I have a tuning adapter attached to the bolt.  I think it would be an enhancement if there was a ""tuning adapter"" coax out on the bolt.  It would simply be a moca filtered split from the input coax jack.  That would take all the mis-configuration problems out of using  a tuning adapter.4.  Tivo suggestions need to be a little ""smarter"".  I constantly delete all the ""sports"" suggestions and then find them back again.5. The ""lifetime"" subscription option needs to be revisited.  I expect within 3 to 4 years, TiVo will have more and better equipment offering.  Why would I pay 4 year subscription fees up front to save what I would most likely not need four years later?  If I bought a lifetime subscription, you can guarantee that I will do everything not to have to buy your latest equipment offerings.Finally, overall, I love the bolt and tivo service.  I am saving $36 a month on my Charter bill.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"January 9, 2016","TiVo is back!	I have been a fan of TiVo since their very first DVR and have owned several of them, but was disappointed when I bought the Premiere because it was so slow. When the hard drive failed on it, I simply cancelled my TiVo membership.Not wanting to pay for the crazy cablebox rentals, I started to look for an alternative that could give me HD content (my previous TV did not have an HD tuner), and be able to record my favorite shows. All my searches would bring me back to TiVo, and when I saw the BOLT, I figured I would try it. I'm glad I did!Very fast interface and great features. While all the other TV platforms fight over Amazon Video, TiVo just supports it, as well as Netflix and Hulu.For just a bit more than the price of an HD DVR cablebox from the cable company for 1 year, I get the BOLT, subscription, and so much more.Oh...and of course, it's compatible with my UHD TV, Even tho there's not much content available yet.I plan on extending this BOLT to my other 2 TVs using TiVo MINIs.CONS: Changing between TV and streamed services feels a bit kludgy.  The remote for My new TV was able to control my other devices without even an attempt to program it. Perhaps is done via the HDMI? Not sure. But it was not able to do the TiVo.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"March 23, 2016","Love It!	Loved my Tivo Premiere, love this more. Setup was easy - just paired it with my old cablecard and I was off and running. It's much faster than the Premiere, all the apps work well, and has the benefit of commercial skip which has worked with virtually every current running program. It doesn't work with older programs or recorded movies but that isn't a big deal. The menu is nearly identical to the updated Premiere menu so there was no learning curve. In addition I set up a Mini in my son's room which was an absolute breeze using MoCA. The only problem I encountered was that I had set it on my DVD player (yes, a 9 year old DVD player that works perfectly!) and the heat from the Tivo (which is considerable) caused the DVD player to seize up! A little rearranging after the player cooled down solved the problem. But the heat output is something to keep in mind.For those complaining about the $14.99 a month charge after the first year just keep in mind that it is WAY more than that for the cable company's DVR on a monthly and they don't have anything that equals the Mini which doesn't have any additional monthly charge.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

I bought this Tivo along with 3 Minis and a Comcast Cable card.  I now pay less than $50 for cable along with $10 for Netflix vs almost $200 for the Direct TV plus Netflix.

The TiVo app for iOS and Android works great. I'm also running the TiVo beta app on my Firestick and it works well enough but I plan on getting a TiVo mini in the near future.I hate the color and design of the box.

For reasons I will not go into, last January we switched to Comcast's Xfinity cable TV service which utilizes their ""X1"" cable box. With a couple exceptions, the Dish Network ""Hopper"" satellite receiver features were SO much better than those of the X1 cable box, but we had a two year commitment with the Xfinity cable service. Enter the Tivo Bolt. It will take a couple years of not paying the monthly rental on the X1 box to recover the outright purchase cost of the Tivo, but the features of the Tivo are SO much better than those of the X1. Actually, the Tivo features are very similar to those of the Dish Network box with two exceptions. The Tivo also acts as a network streamer for the major providers whereas the Dish box did not. The Dish box featured a ""picture in picture"" capability whereas the Tivo unfortunately does not. Bottom line though, we love the Tivo Bolt!",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

What I'm saving will pay for the TiVo mini in less than a year. The commercial skip feature is awesome and the menus are much faster. It's also quieter and takes up less space.

"January 13, 2016","Works Great In Albuquerque!	First, I want to thank Tivo for having the good sense to wait a few weeks before asking for a review.  (How many times have you bought a product only to have the vendor pester you for a detailed write-up 2-days later?  Give me a break! )  I really can't add any superlatives and major kudos that others haven't already covered. My only complaint has to do with the One Pass programming.  A couple of the new (over-the-air) shows my wife picked (out of many!) never seem to get recorded, even tho we can clearly see them being broadcast on live TV, correct channel & time slot.  (Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, for one.)  I've double-checked the option spec's on these few vanishing shows and don't understand why they won't record, tho I'm sure I'll figure it out in time.  But, back to the pluses . . . this Tivo's a sweetheart, especially in the small details that so many other manufacturers overlook.  True, it's not the cheapest gizmo in town, but most cord-cutters - self included - will make the price back in a mere 2 or 3 months.  Go for it!",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

The ""speed"" feature is really great - things go faster yet the voices maintain their same pitch.  A recorded football game or even a fast-moving basketball game is easy to watch and you get through it so much faster.

The idea that TIVO will show you a show you are looking for on Netflix and Amazon is great as well, minimizes searching. It will be almost perfect when HULU is on the menu.The next thing you need are new mini's that work via wi-fi to complete this modern answer to a DVR.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"June 21, 2016","Great system	We cut the cord and are now cable free.  The TiVo allowed us to get shows we couldn't get on antenna alone. Picture is sharp and clear.  We did have to call customer support to set up but with their help we got it up and running in no time. More a problem of being tech challenged than a problem with TiVo.  Customer service was patient and friendly.  And the best part...there is a ""skip"" button that allows us to skip past commercials on recorded shows.

I am a little worried about having to pay $15 a month after the first year, but if they keep updating it, I won't mind.  They just added Hulu so the cross-platform search works on vudu, netflix, amazon, hulu (maybe others?). It's very nice,  and very fast.

"November 1, 2015","Upgrading from Roamio to Bolt - Cost Subsidy, Performance and UI Improvements, Includes Tivo Steam Functionality	I upgraded from the Roamio to the Bolt as soon the Bolt Shipped.  For me, here is the true cost of the Bolt.Price and Tax (purchased from Amazon):  $330.00 less 5% using bank card promotion - $315 less one year's free service $180.00 - less Sale of Tivo Stream whose functionality is built into the Bolt (but missing from Roamio)  $90 - Tivo refunded me back the last month of Roamio which had just begun $15.00 + cost of 2nd remote $30.00. It can easily be seen the upgrade didn't cost me much.What am I doing w/two remotes operating Tivo?  Won't say, but hint - the remote uses RF to control the Tivo box.Performance/Aesthetic/UI Improvements:- Remote is white and does not show dirt, it seems ligher, the quality of the Tivo button in particular is improved- UI now uses a more modern white background- The white curved Tivo is very cool looking. Much cooler than the Roamio- Have not tested the commercial skip feature - its vaporware  unless you watch soap operas during the day. Would have been really handy during the Republican Presidential debate- The UI is much faster. Screens snap. Everything is faster-Streaming in 2nd room is much faster. Faster queuing and less buffering-wifi is much faster-Tivo refunded me back the last month of Roamio which had just begun.Definately worth upgrading!Update:  Suddenly as I began to fast-forward, a prompt appeared asking me if I wanted to skip the commercial by hitting D on my remote. Happened instantaneously.  A killer feature.Dropped the remote on the floor - these remotes are",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

You have to call your cable co to register the serial #, MAC address ect so their system can see the box correctly (but it work pretty good even before i called). All the info you need to give them is displayed right on your tv screen.  I was a little concerned setting up the MoCA... thought it would be an issue.. thought I would have to run wires... NOPE.. it just worked. I had 0 issues setting this up ""0""  TIVO thought of everything. I can not be more impressed.Its not cheap. I bought the Bolt along with two Minis. $600.

Using with OTA (painful to get right for apt at first but now works) but if I have to add basic tv to my cable package, the real hidden value diamond is having my own equipment makes negotiating post promo rates on net or tv w cable company a cinch!  If I cant get promo rates I cancel & my wife simply becomes new subscriber getting promo rates.  Also when you back out the cost of the 1 yr service included $280-$150(would pay more anyway to cable company) and the cost of stream function already included ($130) essentially the box is free.  They are marketing this all wrong, they should show the value above & finance or lease these things to make it easy, then work out local antenna install options like amazon does.  Its not about saving $ on dvr rental but flexibility of having good dvr/content aggregator without having to step up to large channel packages or losing dvr content if you cancel. The world will pay for convenience in between a lifetime cost package and otherwise large monthly cost w/fixed packages of channels dont want just to get DVR.

"April 28, 2016","Very Interesting, Great DVR.	Just received the Tivo Bolt (500gb) yesterday and was not looking forward to setting it up through Cox Communications. It was a nightmare with My Tivo Premier because of the Cable Card and Tuning Adapter. However, I just was replacing the Tivo Premier with the Tivo Bolt and just swapped the cables. After the power on initial downloads to the Tivo Bolt and upgrades, then the activation from Tivo (about 45mins) all my channels were there without even contacting Cox Cable. One expanded channel is still out (Epix), but that happens often by itself.The Tivo Bolt is much faster then my old two channel Tivo Premier and has more features. All my Tivo Apps work, Ipad, Andriod and PC. I can now steam to my Ipads. I connect via Gigabyte Network, and that works great with no effort on my end. Actually, the setup wizard was very easy.I'll keep trying all the features and add to this review, but with few exceptions, I highly recommend this DVR. The one year membership is very NICE.Cons: Made of plastic, not very rigid, plastic does not conduct heat well. Tivo needs to work on DLNA more. The embedded Plex works, but Plex SUCKS. Why do you need Plex to do what DLNA already does. Only one Network Share shows up on my Tivo so far. I'll give it a few days to discover more. The Remote is okay, no new features over the old one. The Cost needs to come down. If you start to make it out of cheap plastic, then trickle down the cost savings. But really, the TIVO BOLT is very nice.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"December 15, 2015","All I Expected and More	I'm a veteran cord cutter who settled several years ago on a  system based on Windows Media Center supplemented with a Roku for each of my three TVs.  My home is wired for ethernet and I have an attic-mounted antenna for over-the-air broadcasts.  This was working quite well until Microsoft deprecated WMC and then switched to a different company to supply the program guide.  The guide was so riddled with errors that it became unusable so I began shopping for a replacement.  I was originally put off by Tivo's recurring charge for the program guide but finally decided that this critical part of the system was worth paying for.I bought the Bolt and three Tivo Minis.  The Bolt is in my tech closet where the antenna termination is and I have a Mini for each TV.  Set-up was simple and I had all four units up and running in an afternoon.  I already had a WD external hard drive that I had previously used with my DISH receiver and it connected to the Bolt with no problems.My family and I like every thing about the Tivo system.  Tivo has been in the DVR business for a long time and it certainly shows in the well-thought-out design of the screens and menus.  A big plus is that this is a mature consumer product that doesn't require me to be the 24/7 on-call tech support guy.  Another pleasant surprise was the integration of the streaming sources with the program guide when doing searches or setting up One Pass recordings.  All of the streaming channels that we normally watch on the Roku are available right from the Tivo menu.

"May 29, 2016","Much better than cable company DVR's	I had a Tivo about 7 years ago and ended up returning it because it just would not work properly with Charter Communications.  I gave it one more shot and bought this Tivo to go with my Time Warner cable.  I am glad to say that this time, it works great. **IMPORTANT information - If you are having the cable company come out to do the install, plug in your Tivo box a least a day before and have it do it's updates.  I didn't realize this and still had the Tivo box in it's packaging when the cable company arrived to do the install.  The tech told me that the over the air update process for the Tivo box takes up to 24 hours and that he could not install it until it was updated.  The tech ended up installing the rest of the system and not the Tivo.  I had to plug the Tivo box into the outlet, hook up the WiFi and then let it go through the setup and update process.  Unlike what the tech said, the whole process only took about 1.5 hours.  Either way, you should be aware of this and have it ready to go if someone is going to hookup this box for you.I love the features on this Tivo.  The commercial skip button is very convenient to have and I really use the Amazon prime video app a lot on my Tivo.  I've had DVR's from Directv, AT&T, Charter Cable, and Time Warner Cable before.  I think it's a toss up between the Directv DVR and the Tivo.  The Directv DVR was very intuitive and easy to use and had 6 tuners.  The Tivo has the Amazon app and 4 tuners.  The fact that it has the Amazon app and it is so easy to watch Amazon Prime videos, makes up for the less tuners and less intuitive system.  Ov",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"January 23, 2016","Just awesome	I've owned the Bolt for about 3 weeks now, and have added 2 Minis, one at a time, since.  It was a somewhat rocky road getting all of the devices configured - especially the Minis, but it was worth it.  The user experience, compared to the FIOS, is like fast forwarding 10 years into the future.  Just the ability to block stations you never want to see again is awesome.  It's fast, intuitive, and fun.  About half the shows I've recorded respond to the ""Skip"" button on the remote, which skips all commercials perfectly.  Wow!  I'm not sure why, but the picture and especially the sound quality has greatly improved.  Most everything is Dolby Digital now - it wasn't before.  And I love not paying $50 at month for the big clunky FIOS boxes and those awful remotes.  In about 12 months, I'll hit the break even for all of the Tivo equipment, and at that point will just be paying $15 a month to Tivo for their service, and whatever FIOS gets for a single cable card, which is all you'll need for your entire TIVO network.Most of my setup difficulties came from Tivo's assumption that if you are a FIOS customer, you are already MOCA enabled.  I wasn't, and caused a lot of headaches.  There's an easy way to tell - if your FIOS router has an ethernet connection coming in, you're not MOCA enabled.  FIOS can set that up for you remotely.  Once you are, makes sure there's no ethernet cable connected to your Bolt - as internet connectivity will also be coming in through the coax cable.  If there is, the Bolt will work fine, but the Minis won't.Tivo rocks!",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

Just wanted a better picture on my study TV than the Comcast HD digital box offered. I got an email announcing the new Bolt and unlike what I suspect is a fairly common dislike of its way ""out of the box"" design I loved it. Finally someone(s) had the cajones to break with the BORING gray or black box paradigm and took a chance on a VERY different enclosure. It's sitting proudly out in the open on a gorgeous maple cabinet like a small fun piece of whimsical art. Inside of course is the Bolt's electronic heart which so far has far exceeded my hopes and expectations. Simply stated it works as advertised. Like hundreds of other actors on ""Inside the Actors Studio"" James Woods, the famous actor who also happens to be an MIT engineering graduate, was once asked by moderator  James Lipton ""What turns you on?"". Without taking a breath Woods immediately answered ""Things that work"". His simple but profound answer took my breath away.

I love the ease and smoothness of the TiVo Bolt. QuickMode takes a little getting used to, but now I use it quite often. I love the SkipMode!!!  That's the way TV viewing should be.

"January 28, 2016","Better Than I Expected	This is my first Tivo device. I've had a DVR through a couple of different cable/satellite providers for years. So when I decided to ""cut the cord"" and use an antenna for over-the-air broadcasts, I didn't want to miss out on being able to pause, rewind, and record live TV. The Tivo Bolt looked like it would do what I wanted and had good reviews on various sites.Well, I'm happy to say, I'm another positive reviewer. It's been great. I won't list all the features here cause it's on the website. But one of the things I like is that the Bolt is recording on all 4 tuners at the same time. Switching between tuners by pressing ""Live TV"" and I can rewind another program while the first one is in commercials. Yeah, I'm one of those remote clickers when a commercial comes on.Also, I like that I can use the web browser or any of my mobile devices to watch anywhere in the house both live and recorded shows.So what don't I like? Fair is fair. First of all, the monthly fee. I'm alright with paying something. But why is it that i'm paying $8 a month for Netflix with all their own programming and thousands of TV shows and movies, but $15 a month to Tivo just to have a cool DVR? Yeah, it's cool. But let's make it more reasonable, shall we? I cut the cord because I didn't like paying for commercial TV. Let's work on that, alright?There's not much bad that I have to say about the Bolt. I don't care about the color or shape. The remote is very nice with the RF ability.

We have been recording OTA through Windows Media Center for years, and while that has worked fairly well this has still been so nice and easy to come back to.  The android app works great and lets us watch our shows all around the house.  The iphone app works fine for most things, but it keeps thinking they arent connected when they are on the same wifi. I am a little disappointed just how many shows will not let you download episodes due to copyright, and since the stream feature outside the house still doesn't work with the Bolt (but every other box) we cant take our shows to go.  Downloading some spare disney shows for our little daughter is a big deal to us and our sanity lol.

"May 19, 2016","Great response, cryptic menus. Overall nice equipment.	Bottom line: Great over all but could use some refinement. Recommended over cable box and nice for over the air where applies.After so much frustration with cable and satellite boxes-we tossed direct-this DVR is the absolute best shy of building your own system. Search ahead and back works well and is very fast responding, its best attribute. Our Cisco cable box won't do that. Menus are still a bit cryptic but work well. You will want the manual, not supplied. Customer service was somewhat helpful but could do better. Our system is on Charter, who supplied an the necessary adapter, about the size and shape of a cable box. It's included with the service but the cable card has a small monthly charge. In short, the DVR works well, does everything it is supposed to do. It is a bit noisy. There is a whine from the system. Not loud but definitely there. You don't want it in a quiet place like bedroom or home office. Set up and logging on is a multi step process. The cable co. was very helpful with that.Only gripe: The customer must continue to pay. We opted for the one year subscription, included. If you want to spend a lot of money, the one time fee is available but who knows how long you'll keep the box or service? They get you either way. To us it's a small price for a good piece of equipment. Compared to the cable box, well worth it if you are making that determination. There is a learning curve once you begin using the DVR so patience is definitely a virtue. We think it's their best one yet but then some features of old are gone and that's a shame.

The Bolt blows it away in speed, and with the ability to record up to four things at once, I am no longer left trying to decide which show I want to drop on those nights of the week when several different channels show their best show.Added to this are two of my favorite features. The speed of the Bolt is amazing. It used to take as much as two minutes to connect and log into Netflix from my Premiere. With the Bolt this seems nearly instant.

"March 6, 2016","So much better than Comcast DVR	I never understood why someone would pay so much for a Tivo box when the cable provider offers a DVR box (for a price...more on that later).  Then I got this Bolt and it is a night and day difference from the terrible Comcast DVR box.  The user interface is much easier to navigate and the channel guide is head and shoulders above the Comcast guide.There are so many features on the Bolt that are better than the Comcast DVR. The one that I appreciate the most is the ""Skip"" button.  Being able to completely and effortlessly skip commercials in recorded TV shows in invaluable.  This feature alone is worth the price of admission.Another feature that I love is the integration of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu.  For the first time since we have been subscribing to Netflix and Amazon Prime are we actually getting our money's worth.  We have a smart TV and an smart BR player with Netflix and Amazon apps but it was way too cumbersome and the apps were hard to navigate.  The Bolt  makes watching Netflix and Amazon so simple and we are watching much much more from Netflix and Amazon.Another feature that I love is the iOS/Android Tivo app that lets you watch live/recorded TV on your smartphone/tablet.  You can stream the show on your home network or download the show for viewing outside your home.  The Bolt does not have the capability to stream to an external network, yet.The last ""feature"" that I appreciate is the cost savings.  We were renting a DVR and two set top boxes from Comcast for about $40/month.  I turned in all of those boxes and replaced them with a Bolt, Tivo Mini, and a Google Chromecast.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

I purchased TiVo bolt 500gb and I had to pick up a cable card (M-Card) from the cable company.  I returned my overpriced cable boxes and canceled my DVR service.  Now I am part of the TiVo family.

"December 7, 2015","Leader of the Pack!	So far, we love it! SkipMode is our favorite feature. The fact that we can go from OTA channels to the streaming channels with one remote and one device is worth the cost. Tried other DVRs and found that the tuners in the TiVo are so much more stable and hold the OTA channels much better. The only negative thing I have experienced so far is when I dial in an OTA channel like 8 for example, it goes to 8-0 (I guess) where there is no station. I then have to channel up one to get to 8-1 since there is no dash key on the remote to type in. So you can't go directly to an OTA channel unless you do it via the guide. I would also ding TiVo for not having HULU as a menu option with the other streaming channels but I have been promised by tech support that it's coming soon. Make good on your promise TiVo! The lack of a HULU option is the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars.UPDATE:  12/08/2015 - I have been corrected on the ""dash"" issue.  Apparently there is a ""dash"" button on the remote I was not aware of.  Apparently it is the small button above the colored green button so I've been told.  Will have to check this out when I get home tonight.  Thanks!UPDATE:  12/16/2015 - Just 10 minutes ago I hit the TiVo button just for no reason but to scoot around the menus to check if there had been any updates to services and such.  At first I was sad to see still only Netflix and Amazon Prime...THEN...right before my eyes, HULU popped into the list...as I was looking at the screen!

"November 14, 2015","The Best Set Top Box Available Today!	I've owned the TIVO BOLT 500GB model for about a month now. Hands down, it is the best (and dare I say, most underrated) set top box I have ever come across. The magic of the BOLT is that it is built for the future of streaming media as well as traditional cable television. For people like me who don't want to spend all their time hunting for content to watch, or aren't ready to cut the cord, his is the product to have. OneSearch and OnePass make it so easy to find and record what you want to watch; you literally set it and forget it. SkipMode on recorded shows is awesome and saves you time, although QuickMode should really be used for shows where dialogue isn't as important (the audio is clear but I still tend to miss things). TIVO suggestions and the box sets allow me to discover new content that I didn't know existed, and the ability to stream shows to my phone or record via TIVO online is great. The price is also fantastic too - $299 is well worth it, given that you get the first year of service free and the continual warranty. Did I mention that I'm saving $60 a year vs. my cable provider's box? Simply put, you need to try this product. It will change the way you watch TV.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"February 9, 2016","Love the Bolt!	I was pleasantly surprised how well this new unit works.  Much better than expected.  It appears to get as good or possibly better reception than my Sony 2014 TV gets.  I am using it in my RV after noting that my Directv Satellite only connects to channels I seldom watch.  Since I installed the Bolt, I have not gone back to the Satellite but once.  I get all my standard TV Stations via my RV powered antenna.  The recordings are great and the SKIP button amazing.  FF and Skip are nearly instant when using the RF Remote unlike my Directv Genie which has about a 2 second delay for everything.I am beginning to believe that cord cutting is the way to go.  This will save me over $100/month in fees and yet give me 95-98% of all the channels I care to watch.I connected my Netflix and Prime to the TiVo Bolt and noted that TiVo will actually show you which sources can provide the show you are looking for and play or record it.  Very intuitive and very fast.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"May 16, 2016","Well worth the investment!!	We've had this unit for a little over 2 months and it is an amazing system.  It took over 3 months to do my research and after finally knowing what I wanted and what the bolt is capable of giving I pulled the trigger and purchased right from the TiVo website.  We are now in full support of TiVo. I opted for the OTA which I installed inside my attic with a 65 mile range even though we are only 30 miles from tower. There are absolutely no pixilation issues at all and with the uncompressed HD signal quality by using OTA it is like night and day between dish, directv and cable companies which have a compressed HD signal. The recording features are impressive and the remote control is extremely responsive. We also have Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime ( which I will also say that all 3 have their own original shows now and is impressive as well ), Pandora and iheart radio. The icing on the cake for me is PLEX, by using my network attached storage with all of our dvd movies and bluray movies and music I'm able  to stream everything through the Bolt. Setup was pretty straight forward as I also opted to connect the Bolt via WIFI.  Take note however, if you connect your mini's do so through Moca and not wireless it's pretty easy just read the directions. It is really nice to not have to switch inputs on our television anymore. Love the skip mode. I have also already installed a western digital 1tb hard drive to this also for added DVR storage.The industry is in fact changing also, everyday to be exact.

"February 3, 2016","I love the TiVo Bolt recording	When I first 'cut the cord' I thought I'd have a tough time of it, and I did. But, I started to research what I could do just to be able to tell what was on TV at any given time. I discovered that there were a number of DVR devices on the market. My research led me to decide on getting the TiVo Bolt. Since then, I have not missed 'cable' at all. The only time I may miss it is during football season, but then I discovered that I can subscribe to 'Sling TV' which broadcast both ESPN & ESPN2. So, during football season I'll subscribe to that... I love the TiVo Bolt recording, program schedule along with the many features thereof, the 'skip' feature, etc. I figure that after the first year TiVo subscription, the $149/yr subscription fee beats $100/mo cable fee six ways to Sunday. Use the TiVo Bolt in conjunction with Netflix, or any of the other content providers and it's 100 times better than cable.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

We retired the old unit to our bedroom, and we discovered an added benefit, that the box's do link with each other and we can watch any recorded show from either room on either box - awesome - pause in living room, and continue in the bedroom.  Full menu from either box on each unit.  Don't know if i will be cutting the cord soon on cable- however with the program guide on the TIVO we can search across platforms such as the tivo, netflix, and Hulu for shows we like, and record them to the unit's for later viewing.  I will be upgrading to Lifetime service on this unit also, as soon as it comes down in price, or when TIVO runs a special on service.  The first year is free, and the guide is worth the monthly fee.

"July 28, 2016","Tivo gets a facelift !	I have been a TiVo customer since their launch. However over recent years, my old TiVo HD went on the shelf in favor of my Roku, Fire TV and Apple TV devices. However when the Bolt was launched I thought the concept of unifying my apps with my OTA TV on one HDMI connection to be an interesting one. So I decided to give it a try. It felt like an old friend having the peanut remote back in my hand, although it felt huge after my Apple TV 4 remote !So far it has lived up to expectations. I love the idea that you can add anything from Hulu, Netflix, HBO and Amazon to your watch list. It extends the size of the drive because all streaming services stream direct from the source, bypassing the drive. As for my OTA recordings, I love the commercial skip feature on the main networks. This alone helps justly the annual TiVo fee, because I detest the interruption of commercials !Talking about the fee, I do feel that it's a bit much and logistically with all the competition out there, I would hope to see a change in their pricing structure in the near future.To sum up I think this device brings TiVo bang up to date, with the combination of the old features we were familiar with and some great new ones.All we need now is for the service fee to drop a little and you'll have a near perfect device to meet all your streaming and network needs.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

I started out with the TiVO Series 2 and it changed my life.  Bye-bye VHS tapes! Being able to to catch a chow midstream and back up 30 minutes - amazing.Then, four years later I went to the Series 3 HD dual tuner.  Being able to record two shows at once while watching a third I had already recorded, TiVo did it again.The last couple of years I had thought about getting the Roamio, then I saw that the BOLT came out. As soon as I read about what it can do it was time to say farewell my friend the Series 3.Being able to track and record four HD channels at once, all while watching a TiVo recording or video on demand from my cable provider or Amazon Prime is a remarkable. I love SkipMode which in some, but not all, cases to skip commercials, but what does it for me though is QuickMode.I love watching the NFL, but many times I do not have 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 hours to sit and watch the game. I will record the game and start watching about halfway through using QuickMode. I can watch the full game in 90 minutes or less using this brilliant feature.After reading about the Roamio, I thought TiVo had scored a ""10"" and was ready to buy, but then the BOLT came out and it is just ""that 'much' better"" so that it is ""one louder"" so ""it goes to 11"".Thank you again TiVo for setting the standard by which all other DVRs are judged.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"October 9, 2015","Love this device!	I purchased the Bolt to replace my cable company's antiquated DVRs. I've been using it for just a few days, but so far I absolutely love it. The ability to switch quickly between streaming services and cable is great.  I love the skip feature, allowing us to press one button to skip commercials on some recordings. It was easy to set up and TIVO support was excellent.  I liked it so well I went out and bought a TIVO Mini for the bedroom.  TIVO Bolt is definitely a big improvement over my cable boxes and the year of free service is beautiful!",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"March 21, 2016","Worthwhile upgrade to my TiVo Premiere	I have 3 TiVo Premieres, and have been very happy with them. But I just couldn't resist the new QuickMode and SkipMode features on the new Bolt.  I am already spoiled by the commercial skip, and now find myself annoyed when I have to skip the old fashioned way. You get spoiled very quickly. The new  unit is also noticeably faster than my old units. Calling up and scrolling through menus is almost instantaneous, and even connecting to one of my older Premiere units on the network is faster. I don't have any need for the UHD yet, but it is nice to know that it is there for when the time comes.Just a few minor complaints: 1) I could have done without the curved unit. I'm not sure whether that design was due to a venting issue or a desire to physically prevent people from putting something on top  of it, but I would have preferred a flat unit, possibly with some feet if they wanted better venting; 2) I don't particularly like the white, and the white remote is going to get dirty faster; and 3) it definitely gets warmer than my old units, possibly because it is a smaller unit with everything crammed into a smaller space. Hopefully that will not shorten its life.Despite the minor complaints I would wholeheartedly recommend the upgrade to anyone with an older unit. I don't know whether it is faster than the Roamio series, so maybe it's not as big an upgrade if you have one of those. But for Premiere users I think you will be very happy with the upgrade.",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"October 25, 2015","TiVo Bolt is a Great New Product that Integrates NetFlix and Amazon Prime with Recording Live Over the Air TV!	Great new TiVo Bolt has it all! No need for a smart TV, ROKU, Apple TV, Satellite TV, or Cable TV. I connected it to my Moho HD  antenna and it gets great reception. The tuner on the TiVo bolt is better than the one on my TV.  It has a very well Integrated interface with over the air shows, recorded shows, NetFlix shows, and Amazon Prime shows. It has one easy to use interface to see all your TV show options on one screen! On top of this, you can stream any content from your Bolt to your phones or tablets in your home, porch or yard. You can also connect to your TiVo app from your phone or tablet while not home, to remotely set a program to record! Finish that show you were watching at a friends house when you get home! The one button instant skip mode on most recorded shows, is super cool as you get there instantly without fast forward guessing! If I ever need more recording  space I can simply attach an eSATA hard drive. Do not forget to buy a MoCA POE Filter to prevent your Bolt from transmitting your home internet signal via your coax connected antenna. The Bolt turns your connected antenna coax into an MoCA (Multimedia over Coax) allowing the connected coax in your house to be used for antenna or wired internet via the coax. This built in feature allows you to use your house coax to connect a TiVo mini to other rooms in your house that have coax already run and allow full access to your TiVo Bolt programming and features on other TVs via this coax or other wired Ethernet cables.Have fun being fully connec",Amazon,0.75,5,Very Positive,BOLT,
"October 23, 2015","LOVE IT.  Replaces Verizon DVR and Roku.  Never looking back!	This is my first TiVo and I love it.  I wish I had ditched Verizon FiOS' DVR years ago.  I love that it searches for shows across multiple providers (cable, Amazon, Vudu, Netflix), and that I can skip past commercials.  Also love that it replaces both my Verizon DVR and my Roku which saves space.  I hated that my Roku transmitted as a Wifi Access point for its remote to function - so that box is now history!  I look forward to the ability to view my recorded programs remotely, which I believe is a feature that will be coming to the Bolt.  My wishlist for the next generation would be the ability to add a large USB harddrive full of my home movies to play through the Bolt interface.  Also, I don't like that they have a small ad at the bottom of the home screen.  I paid a lot of money for this box, do they really have to do that?

Extremely slick and intuitive design, flawless setup, instant responses, and the bonus was the built in MOCA bridge which made adding my 3 TIVO minis a snap. The commercial skip button is wonderful, OnePass setup for streaming (HULU, Netflix...) ensures that I don't miss any of my favorite shows. Even if your not a cord cutter I would highly recommend the BOLT and a couple of minis instead of renting inferior technology from the cable and satellite operators.

I now have the ability to purchase minis at a one time cost to replace all rented cable STB.  Today, I'm saving $50+tax a month NOT renting equipment from the cable company. My return on investment is about 1yr.  The cable co rental fees go up at least $1/year/device. I pay just $4.99 monthly to rent one cable card.  Other than the massive savings, the Bolt UI blows away anything you can rent from the cable company. Fast response times, small form factor, apps, all-in-one solution. What else can you ask for? I'm a fan again. Thanks Tivo!",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

I like several of the Bolt's features including the Skip capability, the ability to remove channels that are not a part of my cable package and the fact that the remote quickly recognized my TV.I also purchased a Mini so I have gotten rid of two cable boxes (and over $40 in rental fees) and get HD programming on multiple sets, DVR capability and improved integration with Netflix and Amazon Prime.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

We got the Bolt and two mini's and it has been an excellent experience.  Easy to install, the one time I had to talk to tech support was an outstanding experience (unlike tech support at the cable company), and in less than six months the recurring fees I was paying my cable company will offset the one-time purchase I made when I bought the TiVo's.  The savings after that is money in MY pocket, not the cable company's.  I highly recommend the Bolt.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

It is my first tivo so I can't compare it to other models.Not only does it get more personalized the more you use , it is made for the next generation of tv resolution with the 4k compatible. Also, I think using this tivo is giving me a better picture on my 1080 tv than it had with the charter cable dvr. The skip mode works pretty good. I like how tivo reminds me to skip if I want.Bottom line is this. If you want to unscramble the 24hrs of cable on 150+ channels to make it your cable guide and watch what you want then this tivo is for you. Sure you can do a lot of these features on the cable company's dvr. The tivo just makes everything easier.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

When the Bolt was launched, decided to jump back in and was pleased to see the things that shouldn't have changed (speed, ease of use, etc.) are all still there but the new feature set really sets this thing apart.  Merging the streaming capabilities in with the live content and recordings makes so much more sense than having them separate.

All of the major streaming apps are here including Plex. The only negative I can say is that there is still no HBO GO. I'm not sure why this can't be done. Nonetheless, the Bolt is lightning fast and improves upon Tivo's already great user interface. The only accessory I would recommend is the Tivo Slide Pro Remote which adds a learning remote, slide out keyboard, and RF signal output which means you don't need to worry about pointing the remote directly at the Tivo, nor do you have to worry about any objects getting in the way.

It's nice to have the option should my needs change.Love the smaller footprint, but I'm not too sure about WHITE! Really.A little disappointed that I wasn't smart enough to realize that SkipMode was for recorded shows only! Silly me. We are so bombarded with advertising these days. Commercials ""OFF"" should be an option for everything! In any case, I love the feature, but don't feel that it's available from enough broadcasters to boast about.Still working on the QuickMode. Haven't used that feature yet.All in all, the value for the up-grade is excellent. Service included for one year makes the Bolt free.

Whenever they asked for feedback, I would always say ""If you want to know how to do it right, copy TiVo.""  As far as I can tell, none of them ever took my advice.So, recently I threw in the towel and came back to TiVo.  I have to tell you how pleased I am.  I purchased and installed a Bolt and three Minis about a month ago.  Almost daily I say to myself ""jeez, I should have done this long ago.""  I won't go into detail, but so many aspects are just so well thought out.The only feature I can think of that I would like to have that isn't available would be the ability to create individual ""Favorite Channel"" lists for the various members of the family so that they could select their personal channel list regardless of which TV they're looking at.

The only issues I had were with setup and how to properly set up the cable card and tuning adapter for my provider. But since it has been set up, I haven't had to reset anything and everything has worked perfectly.  Also can't beat the monthly savings over cable equipment.

I added a TiVo Mini in a second room, and the most time I spent was sitting at the Time Warner Cable office, waiting to turn in my set top box.

I was concerned that the response might be slow or clunky in the second room, but the user experience is at least 95% of what you are used to in the main room.

I just switched to FIOS and was worried that the installer would be clueless when it came to anything other than Verizon equipment.  And I was right! His experience was limited to installing a cable card in a Tivo unit two years ago.  Nevertheless, between the two of us we were able to get the CableCard installed and activated in about 30 minutes.Updating the unit and getting it connected to the internet and my streaming services was very fast, easy and intuitive as is operation of the unit.  The box gives you a lot more customization choices than my old X1 DVR but the information is presented in a way that you are not overwhelmed with options.  The skip and quick mode are fantastic as is the ability to search across platforms.  The best part for a former cable company DVR renter like me?  The unit is blazing fast; you press a button and the channel switches instantaneously or the guide pages down quickly.  No more waiting through 1-2 seconds of lag time as your unit catches up.  The same is true with the selection of Amazon or Netflix titles--everything is fast and seamless the way it should be.The icing on the cake is that TIVO pays for itself within months and then some:  the TIVO Bolt and Mini I purchased (which works as well as the Bolt) will save me $45 a month in device rental and DVR fees.Nice work Tivo, keep up the good work and I look forward to future product updates that will allow for out of home streaming and access to FIOS on demand selections.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

Such a great interface, quick and responsive, looks/feels like top shelf product, performs flawlessly.  Was blown away by how well SkipMode and QuickMode work.  No more start/stop fast forwarding through recorded sports....quick mode gets me caught up INCLUDING all of the commentator audio.  The integration with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and cable provider make this box the unified solution that I craved.

"October 16, 2015","Stop paying Verizon and Cable Co lots of money	So, if you are on Fios and have a multi room DVR at $19.99 a month and a second box rental at $6.99 a month over the space of 36 months you are paying them $971.  Likely the costs are the same for your cable company.If you buy the Bolt for $299 and a Mini for $120 (and for completeness lets bake in the $150 a year for years 2 and 3 service) you will be paying $720 for the same 36 months.  You would only need to pay $180 to Verizon for the cable card.Thats $70 you just saved yourself, but not only that you have just upgraded your TV viewing experience to one with better more organized menus, the ability to watch and program easily on an iPad.  The ability to get Cable, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and more on the one box.Cable companies make it awkward to make this switch, there is a reason, they want you sucked into their own bad quality hardware where they make lots of money on you renting a $75 box for $20 a month!  Make the switch.  If you truly hate it there is a 30 day trial period.  What do you have to lose.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

The rental savings will pay for the TiVO in less than a year.There was little or no hassle in setting it up.  I just followed the instructions and my FiOS was there just like before.  Making plans to move on to a TiVO mini in another room via MoCA.Pros:  Performs just like the advertisements say.Cons: Fumbling with the remote in a dark room.

"December 15, 2015","Long time TiVo owner	I have owned TiVo units for at least 6 years. The difference with cable company receivers is almost unbelievable. First with live tv you can pause one tuner when you get to a commercial, flip to another tuner, watch tv on that tuner till a commercial and then pause it and flip back to the first tuner. NO MORE COMMERCIALS even with live tv. Next edit the tv channels you receive so the guide doesn't show the ones you don't subscribe to. Then start giving thumbs up and thumbs down to shows and TiVo will start to record shows it thinks you will like. You will never regret owning a TiVo unit....",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"January 23, 2016","the Bolt makes great economic sense	My cable company was charging me about twenty five bucks a month (or three hundred a year)  for a DVR box and DVR service. This equates to the cost of the Tivo Bolt with service for 1 year, with the key difference is that after year 1, you can actually ""own"" the Tivo Bolt device (unlike the cable company's box.) Further, in year 2, the TiVO Bolt's cost is cheaper that the cable company's equivalent cost [for DVR box and service] by a whopping 50% since you then only pay the Bolt's $150 subscription fee and no further cost for the Bolt device. On these grounds alone, the Bolt makes great economic sense!I like the fact that Bolt is lightweight and has a chic bent design. I am disappointed, however, that there are no heat vents on the top of the device as is the case with most DVR boxes. With TIVO, I am able to get all the Time Warner Cable channels except for BBC World and ""On Demand"" channels with merely the cable card (and not a ""turning adapter."") Pictures are crisp and I like the sound quality which the Bolt has set to its default Dolby Digital 5.1. Unlike other devices, the Bolt comes with a 4K-capable HDMI cable. And if you ever run short of capacity, you can easily add capacity via the e-sata port. I find that the Bolt is considerably faster at accessing Netflix menus than my Roku 2 device.I could not get the Bolt's volume button to work with my Samsung TV.WHILE TIVO IS GREAT AT CREATING A UNIFIED SYSTEM, IT WOULD REACH PERFECTION IF IT IS A PLATFORM TO also OBTAIN ""A LA CARTE"" CHANNELS.I am giving the Bolt 5 stars for its overall value and because its price includes 1 year of f",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

As Tivo has stated the Bolt is not meant for the classic customer and is meant to create a new class of Tivo users.I'm a FIOS customer looking to save on my outrages bill.  I have 3 TVs with one DVR.  I wanted to lower my monthly bill significantly  So I've switched from owning 3 FIOS devices to 3 Tivo(1 Bolt and 2 minis).  My calculation is that one year of FIOS device rentals will pay for the complete Tivo cost.  Year 2 and on I only need to pay Tivo a $15 a month fee(this fee is waved by Tivo for 1 year when you by a Bolt) vs the never ending device cost associated with FIOS.  You do need to rent a Multi cast -CableCard from FIOS about $5 a month.So far the only loss is FIOS ondemand.  I mostly get by that feature by using Netflix, Hulu, ... which is built into Tivo.  You can still use FIOS ondemand via other devices(tablet, smartphone, laptop, ...).Everything else is so much better.- Remote devices from the DVR are no longer glitchy.  Everything works as expected.- Interface works smoothly, clean, and modern.- One touch commercial skip is wonderful.Also the Tivo devices will work with any cable provider I may switch to in the future(FIOS, Cox, Dish, DirecTV).I recommend that classic Tivo customers not down this device and wait for the evolution of the Roamio.",Amazon,0.62,5,Very Positive,BOLT,

"October 23, 2015","Almost perfect it just needs a few software tweaks.	I've had the Bolt for about two weeks now and for the most part, I am extremely impressed with TiVo's new model, the Bolt. It is far superior to the stock Ciso unit offered by my cable provider Charter.I thought the price was very reasonable at $299 for 500GB (there is a 1TB option for $100 more where 500GB = 75 HD hours, 1TB = 150 HD). Well worth it, considering they give you one year of service for free which saves me 12 months of cable box and DVR fees.  I did have to go by Charter and get a Cable Card and a Tuner Adapter in order to make the Bolt work. Charter charges $2 a month for that. I read some cable companies offer it for free. To set it up, there was a small quick start guide but be prepared to go to the web site to download the full manual.Commercial Skip mode works perfectly on recorded shows, but is not offered on all networks. It's still a welcome feature. After you record a show, a little green ""Skip"" icon will show up on the show later if Skip is available.  You get to a commercial, press the D button on the remote, and it flawlessly moves to right before the program starts again. It even works midway through the commercials.  I've seen claims it will currently work on about 20 networks which you would think would be the majors, mostly",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,
"December 13, 2015","Like it except for one thing.	One little tweak could have made this perfect.  I recently cancelled my Dish Satellite service.  I've been watching TV from my HDTV Antenna mounted on a 30' mast, and pulling in Amazon and Netflix from the Amazon Fire TV.  I bought the Tivo for two reasons, to be able to record shows from the antenna without having to watch commercials, and to not need the Fire TV.  Don't get me wrong, I love the new 4K Fire TV (even though my TV is only capable of 1080P), but I just thought I would use the Tivo Bolt for everything. I run everything through a Yamaha Receiver, and it just would have made for less switching of inputs.It would have worked except for one thing, controlling Amazon content from the Tivo remote (pause, rewind, fast forward, etc) was a PITA with the Tivo remote.  I much prefer using the dedicated Voice Remote that comes with the Fire TV, it's interface is much more user friendly.All in all, I really like the Bolt. It's worth it to me to spend $149.00 a year to have the ability to record and skip commercials from Broadcast TV.Just wish the remote were a little more user friendly so I could have used it for everything. In my opinion, that's the only thing keeping this from getting 5-stars.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

After all the initial updating (which was a little time consuming) the Bolt has proven to be one of the greatest things I've ever invested my money in. (entertainment-wise) Picked up my cable channels immediately and though I no longer use it the suggested shows feature was very interesting and surprisingly spot-on. Having 4 shows to record at once was a godsend! SO glad to give Comcrap back their terrible, sluggish DVR. Initially I didn't think the SkipMode thing was going to be a big deal because fast forward always worked for me. Never have I been so wrong...OMG! It's one of those things I can't live without now. The integrated apps is simply wonderful. All my app subscriptions right there on the same input as my cable. And they have the Plex app which delivers all my entertainment media stored on my PC right to my TV. Why these TiVo people put Plex under the music menu I have no idea. Someone dropped the ball on that. Anyway...not only does the Bolt record shows like a traditional DVR but it also pulls your shows from streaming services if available. I mean...WOW! Thank you! The Bolt also streams to your mobile devices on your network and recorded shows anywhere you have a decent data connection. It's fantastic. Now, that cooking show",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

Love the guide and recommendations.  New this Fall, new comedies, .....Only had about a week. Love ease of use.  Hooked to a $6 antenna and get about 40 stations. The curve design makes placement an issue. It was very easy to install Hulu, prime, YouTube.  The skip function is nice but so many stations dont offer its easy to forget about. Not sure any it allows recording of streamed items.  Maybe that's important if you are interested in connecting to other devices or expect loss of internet.Have to test this out if the internet goes down to see if I can access everything except the guide.Wish the subscription weren't so high.  If they offered movies etc I might understand. Also, not allowing subscriptions to transfer to new devices is horrible. Lifetime subscription and then you are penalized for getting TiVos new technology.  I got 1 year with device so it will be cheaper than renting a box from cable provider when we get it.

"March 9, 2016","Very good product	Very nice product but I nearly returned it when it kept freezing up repeatedly.  Neither the technicians from TIVO or Time Warner Cable had a solution that corrected the issue until a TWC technician came to see the set up which was done the way it was said to be done per TWC instructions.  Instead of the coax first going into the digital tuner provided by TWC and then into the Bolt the solution was to put a splitter on the TWC coax, sending one line in to the digital tuner and one in to the Bolt.  After that was all done no more freezing or locking up.  That was something I could have easily done myself but instead it cost me $30 for a repair call.  TWC should have altered their instructions and TIVO should learn of this problem.Apparently the white vertical lines on the time line (when pause is activated) can't be jumped to on the Bolt, so why are they there then?Besides those two issues, the Bolt is a very good product.  I use the QuickMode a lot.  Loading of the streaming sites is quite fast.  Skip mode is great when it's available!I wish the fan was a bit quieter.I wish the time line bar would disappear after two seconds in the pause mode since sometimes I'm trying to read or see some important information in that area.

"March 13, 2017","Software is amazing.  Hardware should be more robust.	Using the TiVo to watch your television shows generally spoils you for any other set up.  It is supremely easy to use and particularly responsive on the Bolt.  I've had a TiVo since the year 2000.  The weak spot in the Bolt is the durability of the hardware, it seems particularly vulnerable to voltage fluctuations  along with some other glitches that would not bother other consumer electronics.  We've had to replace more than one box.  They seem to have substantially improved the quality of the individuals handling tech issues and customer service lately , some early  experiences we had were far from acceptable.

I use the TiVo in conjunction with the Nvidia Shield which is my main unit for viewing content, however the Shield has no access to Amazon Instant and watching live Over the Air TV Broadcast are a bit to sensitive when the signal degrades for a brief moment. This is where the TiVo Bolt shines for me at least. Any degradation in signal, the TiVo quickly recovers and most times you don't even notice it, where as with the Shield and Nexus Player, there's a 10-second pause in video while the audio continues to play. 500GB hard drive with a ESata slot on the rear for more capacity is sufficient enough for seasonal viewing. Netflix, and Vudu (vudu is not available for Android TV) ,YouTube, Plex, and a few more apps are available.

"May 27, 2016","Best decision I've ever made (be patient with the cable cards)	After putting a lot of thought into it, I finally decided to cut the cord. Best decision I've ever made. I love this box. I don't like the constant  humming sound it has since it's always on, and it does get a little warm which concerns me. For this reason I never leave it plugged in when I go away on trips which is a little inconvenient because I miss out on recordings. But I'd rather be safe. I spoke to someone from TiVo and they confirmed that the humming sound I hear is just the fan cooling the box.Let's discuss cablecards for a moment. Cablecards are the most annoying thing on this planet. I have comcast and it's sad to see how many people do not know how to troubleshoot these cablecards. Take my advice, be patient. These cards will test you, but do not let them win. I went through almost 10 before I found the one that worked. Even the reps at my local comcast location told me to keep calling back until someone that knew what they were doing would take my call. Some cards actually don't work, and then when a card does work, the rep on the phone doesn't know how to activate it. I was really close to just buying an HD antenna.Good luck.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

Unprogrammed the remote and now the TV generally will turn off/on, but this means I need to use both the tivo remote and the TV remote for power/volume/mute. Big inconvenience/disappointment.

"March 1, 2016","It's fantastic - And Easy to Modify for More Storage!	Let me start by saying that I think the Bolt is pricey for the size hard drive you get. Storage is inexpensive and TiVo skimped a bit here.So, I bought a 2GB drive and swapped out the hard drive in the new bolt before turning it back on. TiVO doesn't even sell a 2 GB Bolt, but now I have one!A few things I didn't expect (which I like):+ The resolution is much better than what I had with my cable company DVR. less artifacts, faster channel changes, and smoother fast forward.+ Skip Mode and QuickMode are insanely awesome - you'll wonder how you lived without them+ The system seamlessly integrates with streaming services - the netflix app on the bolt is gorgeous.Sometimes Pandora/Spotify crashes, but I blame those apps, not the Bolt. I wish I could stream outside the home like Slingbox can. That feature is sorely missed. I also wish Tivo Minis were less expensive or that I could use my appleTV like a TiVo mini.I would pay $40 for an app that let me use my appletv box as a TiVo mini.

"November 18, 2015","Significant Upgrade over TiVo HD, Not Perfect.	I upgraded from the TiVo HD from 2008. It's a HUGE upgrade. The OS refresh was much needed, and is significantly faster to browse than the older version.  Skip mode is a nice addition, though it's not always available, sometimes even on very popular shows (and certainly not for at least a few hours after broadcast). I get a surprising amount of use out of QuickMode . It's a great way to get through a backlog quickly.While I don't particularly mind the strange new curved look, functionally it's awkward. I used to have a digital clock on top of my TiVo. Now it has to go to the side. It's not a big deal, but it's strange.I've had the unit for just over a month, and have had one solitary issue of the OS freezing. It seems pretty stable, but when it happened two days into our relationship, I was quite frustrated. A reboot fixed the problem and it hasn't popped up since. Hopefully it was a one-time thing.UPDATE: The fan on the TiVo Bolt is quite loud -- if you plan on purchasing this device for a bedroom, you may want to reconsider.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

This is my first DVR, and I love it......as I also love saving the leasing fees from the cable company.  The included 1st year of service was big in getting me to buy this .... otherwise it would be tougher to cost justify the purchase. ..... also key was the fact that my two attached minis do not have any service fees associated with them.  If there was an option to purchase the 2nd year of service in advance .... at a discount, then that would have made my decision to buy a tivo even easier .... as it mostly comes down to whether it makes financial sense between leasing and owning.I'd rather see you sell more bolts by making it very easy to change out the harddrives to larger models.  There are very good articles for how to upgrade the bolt and roamio devices with bigger harddrives.  If harddrives were simply built into a hot-swap type sled that would be pretty exciting to everyone.  Basically sell your bolt's with the harddrive as an accessory, at close to mareket prices....or even without the harddrive.

I called that number and the first person I spoke with helped me in a competent fashion.  Once activated, it took Comcast on-demand overnight to show up but everything else worked almost immediately.The unit itself is an excellent DVR and cable box combination and I like it better than the Comcast unit.  The ability to watch recorded shows on a second TV using my Fire TV is a great feature.  I got rid of our primary rented DVR and an additional rented DVR to save about $40/month.

Better than any other DVR service.With that being said, below are a few of the negatives that we identified.  Some of it can be fixed with software/firmware updates.- Equipment is a little expensive, but  it is acceptable considering money saved dropping tv services.  However, the service fees are expensive.  Especially, considering we dropped tv services due to expensive service fees & poor service.  TiVo currently offers life of the device for $600. If that was lifetime service, I would pay it right now & be a TiVo customer for life.  Or they could lower their annual fee to at least $100.- Also, the necessity to hardline an Ethernet cable to the TiVo mini is a design flaw.  This restricts where you can put your TV & the TiVo mini.  It should work via wifi.- One major feature that is missing is DLNA functions. It has Plex, but we have a WD Cloud & can stream our content to TV without Plex. It would be nice to tap into our own content without having to switch remotes.- TiVo is missing a couple of key apps.

The average user will probably never have a problem with the interface - and it does offer a lot more than my old Series 3 Tivo - but many of the menu options are still lacking flexibility.  For example, the ""Suggestions"" recorded about 25 ""financial news"" shows over the past week.  No idea why, and no way to make it not record them.

I was using a PS4 and smart tv + set top box rented from comcast. The Bolt goes faster than the PS4 on Netflix, youtube, amazon and I can switch between live tv and streamed media so quickly!The only downside is that the price is pretty expensive, but you get a year of the tivo service included. The bolt can actually save you money if you rent multiple set top boxes from your cable provider.I'm loving it so far and I think it was worth every penny considering I'm able to better utilize my comcast services... searching for tv and shows, I am now comparing things that are streamed on netflix and amazon, with things that are on comcast's video on demand (which I rarely used before due to the slow processing of the previous set top box and the atrocious user interface for searching).",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

Season Pass is terrific, allowing automatic recording of all your favorite shows. Streaming services are integrated, so say goodbye to switching inputs. The classic Tivo Peanut remote is comfortable, intuitive, and durable. A great feature of the remote is it's use of IR/RF, eliminating the need for line of sight. This is great for me, as I keep the unit behind a cabinet door.Monthly service fees are cheaper than those of the cable company, making the Tivo that much more attractive an alternative to the terrible DVRs that the cable companies offer.You will need a cable card for most channels. Premium channels, such as NFL network, will require a tuning adapter as well. Cable card fees are about three dollars a month, and I'm not charged for the tuning adapter.The bolt loses a star with me for it's dumb design.

(I still use the Romio and will sometimes need to transfer shows from that one to the Bolt because the Bolt recording was pixelated and missed half the show.)  On the other hand, I must say that the picture quality on the Bolt looks better and the Tivo menus look nicer too.  I do like the fact that you can use the mobile app to download shows to your mobile devices - but on the flip side, the app does NOT allow storing the shows on micro sd cards which means you can't store that many shows on the device (unless you paid a fortune for a high capacity device).  And finally, the Bolt was used to replace an even older Tivo that had an external drive.

There are still issues:  I haven't been able to get the premium channels or On Demand by Comcast.  Tivo says this is a Comcast issue.

It works well and I'm happy with it.Pros:  It's physically small.  The menus are fast.  It allowed streaming of Xfinity (my cable provider) on-demand content.  Records 4 shows at once.  It's a TiVo, so it does all the things TiVo has always done well.  If you're considering a TiVo purchase, you likely already know those things.  Considering you get a year of service with it, you're only paying about $150 for the box itself.

Only HDMI video out; No composite or component, so older sling boxes (for example) are not compatible. This Bolt is trying so hard to be the only box hooked to your TV (offering lots of streaming video sources), that the video/menu interface is rather cluttered. It's very similar to the previous HD interface, but there's something to be said for the simple/old SD interface.

Color me more than a little disappointed, and if drives don't soon become available, color me looking for a class-action suit for false advertising to join.No access to any On-Demand services from Time-Warner; not a fault of TiVo, but it would have been nice to know.Cancelled shows frequently show as due to lack of space, when that isn't the case; original time slot moved, channel not available, etc. This combined with the sudden disappearance of expansion drives makes for more paranoia than necessary about capacity.Another casualty of going to the cable card (and another Time-Warner, not TiVo problem) is a number of channels are no longer available without a Time-Warner DVR or purchase of additional packages.

The information provided by TIVO concerning the parameters as to which programs would be targeted was very misleading (I understood shows from the top 20 networks between 4 pm thru midnight to cover the late night shows). I still do not know what is covered but I did get a response to one of my surveys which stated that just because a show was marked SKIP once does not mean that each current episode would be so marked. This is disappointing and deceptive. Concerning those shows that do get tagged, the feature works very well 99% of the time. Some are dead on, some are off by a second or two. A few times the beginning SKIP is omitted but I know once the commercial starts to hit the CHANNEL FORWARD (this is by far a better choice than the D button for this elderly old fellow). So I am 85% happy with the feature and hope that the number of shows are increased. Even though I am still paying for my subscription on the Roamio (I knew that I would be), I genuinely feel that the move was very worthwhile.

That was a reasonable purchase (~$50 for the MoCA adapter) and it seems that streaming videos play a bit faster than before.I really like the streaming video integration, which allows you to schedule OnePasses that find streaming videos.

For example, there was an HBO documentary on James Foley (""Jim:  The James Foley Story"") and Tivo Bolt's search functionality couldn't find it.  However, when I went to Xfinity Video On Demand and manually searched for it within the app, it found it and I was able to play it on demand from HBO.  Not sure why Tivo couldn't find it, but most of the time, search works great.I like that the Bolt is more compact than the Tivo HD; the Bolt also seems quieter and looks more attractive than the Tivo HD.

It's available on ~10% of my shows.- There are now only two lights on the front of the box.  The problem with this is that you can no longer see how many tuners are actively recording by looking at the front panel.-  Cannot cooperatively record with other TiVo boxes (explanation below)What I mean by cooperatively record: I own a TiVo Premiere XL4 with four tuners, and I have recently added a TiVo Bolt, which also has 4 tuners.  This should mean that I have 8 tuners capable of recording - in tandem - with the same OnePass.  There are times when 7 football matches are available to record, creating conflicts and causing the tuners to not record three of them... what should happen is that the tuners on the second box should take over the remaining recordings.  The libraries of two home-networked TiVo boxes should be compiled and displayed as a single library.

You can stream a lot of services directly through this device (Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO Go, Hulu, YouTube, MLB.TV, Plex, VUDU, HSN are just a few.) Of course, these services require additional sign up and fees. The only issue I have is with the updating of the system. 1.) It does not work through wireless service so I have a hard line to the system which is ugly 2.) It is supposed to update automatically on a daily basis. However, it fails constantly. I have to start the update myself, it will then fail, but if I update it a second time right away, it succeeds. I have been on the phone with TIVO and they are unable to resolve so I have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to do the updating myself. I have done research and they apparently have been aware of this issue, but no resolution. If you can deal with those issue, the price is right.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

Clearly this one will always be on top of other players. (Sounds like a product tag line in there somewhere).Fantastic to finally see 4K support, but at 500GB for the base unit, and 1TB on the higher end, it's not nearly enough. 2TB should have been the minimum drive size. Considering this would have been a marginal cost increase, it would have been worth the investment.It seems faster than previous models, and I love the new skip feature.Very disappointed to find out that there is no out of home streaming with this unit.

This is the only Plex app that has the issue, on a Roku it works just fine.2. Give the option of not even showing the SD channels during onepass recordings, to do list for recordings, as a matter of fact, have a toggle to hide the SD channels if an equivalent HD channel exists. Direct TV does this, why not Tivo.3. Have the default for onepass be able to set it somewhere and have them stick. I don't like that I have to change all my onepasses to record only and new episodes only. This should be a global setting that you can select.4.

"October 23, 2015","Great box, going in the right direction with lots of room for improvement.	The new features are amazing. Commercial skip on late night channels only really needs to expand to the other channels. Search across different sources like Netflix and cable is great too. However, the lack of apps like HBO Now makes this limited. The box also needs to be able to accommodate OTA and Cable, not one or the other. I had gotten used to watching local channels OTA because OTA picture quality is a significant improvement over the HD cable signal (I'm guessing it's their horrible compression that degrades cable picture quality). However, I'm still stuck in the situation of swapping inputs for watching OTA and Cable with the Bolt - this also means the unified search feature cannot include both sources either. That is disappointing. The remote commands transferred to my Harmony One perfectly. However, the TiVo remote seems to be missing Page Up and Page Down on the channel guide. Altogether it's been a pleasant experience but there is definitely large gaps in functionality that need to be filled out.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

My first BOLT was defective and got part way through setup and got into a booting loop. The retailer replaced it and the second unit worked fine, but then the cable card from Comcast was bad and had to be replaced. It took four calls to Comcast to get the card activated and paired properly. Once activated and paired, the guide didn't populate fully and half the channels listed programming as ""To be announced."" Tivo support had me factory reset and do a guided setup again and that resolved the issue. I'm a fairly technical user and the setup if it went well would have been pretty smooth, but with a bad BOLT and then bad cable card, Comcast not being great at activating and pairing it and the programming guide issue, this would have been a real issue for lots of folks.I am running with one Bolt and two minis and so far am happy with the setup.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

It is WAY more responsive than my old cable boxes which used to drive me crazy with the lag when I tried to use the guide.  It is so much smaller and tucks away and the RF remote is a nice convenience so I can stash it even more out of sight.  The DVR experience has always been superior to the cable companies and I love how Tivo has much better algorithms to record and recommend shows.  The integration with apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime make it so much more convenient to have a ""one stop shop"".  Even my technology challenged mother was able to navigate through it with ease.  The ability to stream or download recorded shows to my phone is a great option for entertainment when I travel.  And in a little more than a year I'll break even on the cost of renting from the cable company and will be saving money.Why not 5 stars?  A few, relatively minor, opportunities. - I'd like to have more streaming services available, like Watch ESPN or some of the major networks.

"January 25, 2016","A Solid Start with Minor Missteps	Overall, the Bolt is an impressive new offering from Tivo.  Faster than previous units and just as easy to use, there are only two issues that keep it from getting five stars - the new ""flat"" UI and the noise created by the unit's fan.Ever since Windows 8, companies have been flocking to the ""flat"" UI trend, despite users providing feedback that they do not like it.  The Bolt now sports a user interface that is very reminiscent of the very cable boxes Tivo users are kicking to the curb, with a dark blue background and shades of lighter blue and white for the user controls.  Other colors are practically non-existent, and the look has become very pedestrian.Of bigger concern is the noise from the fan.  I installed the Bolt in a room that I don't use a lot in the winter.  A few days later, I was sitting in that room with nothing else on and noticed a hum I had never heard before.  Since the Bolt was the only thing that had changed, I checked, and sure enough, it was the cause.  What was odd was I have my Tivo set for maximum power save mode - it goes to sleep after two hours of non-use.  No one had been watching TV that day, but it was still humming away.  A quick Google search showed similar feedback from others.Outside of those two issues, the Bolt is a solid offering, and",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

The capacity and 4-channel tuner are awesome!  It's smaller and doesn't get as HOT as my old TiVo box (which is still operating fine AND it's still integrated into the new system! - I can access the programs on it through the Bolt box even though it's in the basement connected to my router via Ethernet connection).I also have a Tivo mini on my kitchen TV.  It is so awesome to finally watch my shows in another room!!!  It works completely seamless with the Bolt - like the main box is in the same room.  I have it connected via MOCA network (the existing coax lines).  The mini remote works without line of sight so i have it tucked out of sight behind the TV for a very clean install.My biggest complaint is that I was sold on the streaming feature only to find out it doesn't work outside of my home network.  Very disappointing.  Streaming inside my home network is a useless feature for me - if i want TiVo in another room i'll get another TiVo mini.I was able to transfer a recording to my MacBook Pro last night after a lot of frustration and 3rd party software that took up almost a Gigabyte of space on my hard drive for JUST the software (",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

I took a quick look at alternatives and ended up with Charter Cable service, which give us fine service in almost all respects - good package of channels, good reception, and fast internet. We also avoid the occasional disruption to service that we suffered through with DirecTV whenever storms would prevent our dish from receiving a good satellite signal.I say 'almost all respects' because I deeply hate the user interface that the cable system provides, and especially coming from the very user friendly and informative DirecTV interface, it was an unpleasant change. After just a week or so of suffering through the cable systems own system of menus and so forth, I started to look into alternatives, and ended up purchasing a TiVO Bolt directly from TiVO.Installation with the cable hookup was difficult.

Most A/V components are black and have a sleek look that will blend in with your other components.

Have used Tivos since the very first model, and the family always preferred the interface over the cable company DVRs.  So far, the Bolt wors just as expected, and is much faster than the older models we had.  Cable card installation was easy this time around, as well.  The only negatives so far are the white color, some trouble getting the mini to connect (oddly the problem was resolved only when I changed the Mini name to a one-word name rather than two as suggested on some of the forums), and the lack of an affordable lifetime subscription option compared to the past.",Amazon,0.45,4,Positive,BOLT,

Customer service was very easy to access and helpful.  I was especially surprised that the agents appeared to be US based.TIVO Bolt makes a big deal about the commercial skip button.  It ends up that this function is only available on certain shows - maybe 10% or so of total programming.My mom does like the fact that she can access Netflix and Hulu via Bolt.The remote has the selector buttons near the top when it's more natural that those primary buttons should be positioned in the middle of the remote.

"January 23, 2016","Cutting the Cord with TiVo Bolt	After 10 years with DirecTV we decided to ""cut the cord."" After some research, we elected to go with TiVo for over the air television and Internet streaming. I was very disappointed when Bolt did not support Hulu but TiVo Mini did. TiVo did finally roll-out their Hulu app for Bolt about ten days after we purchased the Bolt.Thus far, I have four complaints about the Bolt: First, TiVo kept downloading stuff that I had not wanted to record, I know they say that I can train the Bolt over time to know what I like but that is nonsense. We have four users in the house that all like different things, there is no way that I can associate preferences with a viewer profile; something you can do with Netflix. I ended up with over a hundred unwanted programs being recorded that I had to delete one at a time. As a result, I shut this feature off.Second the app menus are different between the two TiVo devices that I own. I bought them on the same day and expect them to look and act the same but they do not. On my Mini, Hulu never remembers what I have been watching and I have to go to a generic screen and search for the same program every time I watch the next episode of the same show.The DVR feature of the TiVo which is supposed to be the main selling point of the unit for live TV is rath",Amazon,0.325,4,Positive,BOLT,

Not to mention any of the other smaller, or local ones!  So as I love the BOLT still does not YET completely replace the ROKU or FireTV unit on the same TV.  It does do Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.  Also the included version of Plex does not handle the streams as well as my other devices, audio seems to get out of sync more often on it.

My WISH LIST  It would be nice if the BOLT  had a good video processor that could up convert everything to 4k resolution (Automatic)  for the customers that have a 4k TV instead of just pass thru -  With the cost of Hard Drives now you should be able to offer the BOLT with more options up to a 2k or 3k HD - Definitely need to offer the BOLT in Black -  My white Bolt is in a dedicated HT Room that is completely Dark -  The white color really stands out Need Black.

I have learned that these units last about 2-3 years before requiring some kind of service, usually a disk replacement or worse.  The service subscription ends when the unit dies and cannot be transferred to another unit - so you have to either fix the unit you have or start all over again.

Oddly, just seeing what's on TV can be a bit of the battle; the options presented seem heavily filtered and curate d by Tivo, and I have yet to find an option to just show me what each tuner is busy doing. I also find it odd that the Tivo BOLT can do cable *or* OTA, but not both.

It's only available on select shows and times each day, and even then there's sometimes a delay after the show finishes before the skip updates are added to the recordings.The new Bolt box shape and color is unattractive and also makes it difficult to stack with other entertainment center equipment because nothing can sit on top of it any more. I also really miss the lights on the front that showed not just when at least one show was recording but how many shows, as the Roamio did. There's now just one recording light with the Bolt. Also on the Roamio boxes when you were transferring a show from another box or device there was a blue light that indicated the transfer in progress. That too is gone and they just use the multi-purpose yellow light now. Certainly nothing huge, but one",Amazon,-0.325,2,Negative,BOLT,
"February 22, 2016","This device might get sent back.  Too many negatives.	Setup was pretty rough.  Had to call in twice to get it working. plus a bunch of time on the web site.  Silly that it doesn't just work out of the box and then have you sign up soon after.Video playing apps get closed whenever you bump the wrong button on the remote.  That's quite the pain in the bum.  Sometimes in those apps it takes quite a bit of time to get back to back to where you where.Really bad how limited the apps are.  When there is an app, which is rare, it doesn't let you watch live, or even setup things to record in most cases.Also the lack of out-of-home streaming is just silly.

"April 26, 2016","Buyer beware	This isn't about the Bolt so much as Tivo as a company.  I've been a customer since 2000 and I've enjoyed their products.  If you know what their monthly fees are you know I've given them a LOT of money over the years.  Currently I use the HD DVR 55C0.  They've made it so if you let your subscription run out it will no longer be permitted to obtain programming information from Tivo.  Also you cannot use online features such as sending programs to record via the Tivo website as we used to do.  I'm okay with them moving onto new projects and not receiving updates to built in features to my older Tivo but am not happy they are taking away services as I doubt it would take much to at least keep them at their existing state.  Thousands of dollars later I'm left having to leave Tivo as a customer as a result since I won't be bullied into getting the Bolt.  I'm looking at the Channel Master DVR instead as there is no monthly fee.

I've had the Bolt for a month+ now and am frustrated enough to finally post my review.Does it record my OTA TV shows?  Yes.  This is one of the reasons I purchased it.  2 starsDoes it come close to eliminating my need for other devices so that I can watch Hulu, PLEX, Netflix etc.?  Not quite.  I finally gave up on using the Bolt for Plex and went back to my Fire TV box.  Too many lockups and strange occurrences with the Bolt.  No Hulu is a huge negative for me.  I also bought the Tivo Mini in hopes that I could get Hulu through it in another room.  NO GO.  Simply too buggy...maybe because it links to the Bolt and the Bolt doesn't have Hulu yet?Overall design leaves a lot to be desired.  The plug itself took up 2+ spots on my power distribution unit.  Could they not have come up with a better design?  Noisy fan from time to time?  Yes!Usable right out of the box?  NO!  I had to run through the setup and then wait for many hours for the unit to update/activate.  Welcome to 2008.Lastly - What is with all of the ADS that clutter the interface and pop up when I pause a show?  FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line is that I am sorry I purchased this.

"October 6, 2015","nice machine but no out of home streaming is major issue	OK so after having the machine for several weeks here is the updated review:For ME, it is still 2 stars.It is a fast machine in terms of the screens moving along although not quite as fast I thought it would be compared to Roamio but every little bit helps.  There is an odd hesitation when hitting play from the main screen to get the show to start.  I believe this is a bug but it is very noticeable and you sometimes think the remote did not register the play button hit but it does this on the smart phone app as well.Streaming (in-home) this works fine on iPads and iPhones and Android devices.  I have tried on all of them.Streaming (out of home) is not present.  This is a deal killer for ME  and I stress that.  The comments seem to think I am a bad reviewer because I think a feature they advertise should actually work.  The reason for me this is a major issue is it is the reason I have Tivo over other competitors I travel and therefore being able to access things remotely makes it worth the price.  Tivo advertised this to current Roamio subscribers and on their website.  So it should work.  Advertising it then putting in their updated guide sometime in 2016 is a joke.

Then the HDMI output would stop working but the rest of the system would work. A power cycle would fix that. Then no more video output no matter what. I could tell the rest of the Bolt was working because I could access my recordings via TiVo Desktop and it was still recording new shows. Still under warranty, I shipped it back and they sent me another one. A few months after that, the same exact thing started happening again.

"November 23, 2015","DON'T waste your money on the all new TIVO BOLT	I bought the all new TIVO Bolt and stream Amazon Prime didn't work.  i first called Amazon support because the message said to wait or contact Amazon.  After many technical support persons, they said to restart my TIVO.  That was a waste of time.  I called TIVO technical support and they said they were aware of the problem and they would refer the problem.  They said it would take several days for a software update to be sent to my box.  After several days without a fix, I boxed the unit up and sent it back.  TIVO in the past gave discounts on lifetime service if you were a previous customer.  TIVO gives you one year service for the first year and you can now purchase the lifetime for only $599.  REALLY.??How many years do you need to own this unit to break even?  You can only record less than 75 hours of HD programming on the 500 unit and even less if you record 4K video.  Previous TiVo box could record hundreds of hours of HD and had six tuners.  The all new Bolt only has four tuners.  How about watching away from home TIVO shows?  No",Amazon,-0.902,1,Very Negative,BOLT,

This is the data that allows the card to correctly associate the digital broadcast streams with the channel numbers, which lets the program guide data from the TiVo box record the right channels.  The known issue is that with some CableCARDs it fails at a very specific percentage number.However, not all CableCARDs are affected and many Cox users are able to set up their TiVo boxes just fine.  We would encourage you to either reschedule them or to see if you can pick up a CableCARD from their local office to try the setup again.

"January 30, 2016","Promising, but poor performance and insane activation process kill it	Since Verizon and the cable companies do anything they can to impede the use of Cable/M-cards, I didn't expect this to be easy. But the Bolt's hardware, setup process, and online service make this product unusable.SetupThe process for me began with an update. I have a 75Mbps FIOS connection, so this shouldn't have taken long. It took about 40mins to download and another hour to install. But software packages can be big and I was prepared to be understanding. Then came the setup wizard. Nothing special. A few questions followed by a suggestion to call Verizon for activation (though the phone number was wrong). After a litany of lunacy, Verizon activated my Cablecard, though that didn't mean I got any television. After that came the connection wizard -- which took the better part of an hour to run; I left at this point.I was then informed that I'd need to activate a TiVO account. That seemed reasonable, so I went online, created an account, and paired the Bolt. And then I waited, and waited, and waited, and rebooted,",Amazon,-0.902,1,Very Negative,BOLT,
"January 3, 2016","Don't waste your time.	The Bolt is a waste of money. TiVo doesn't like the cable companies and the cable companies don't like TiVo so they don't share information well. Which, causes issues. I couldn't get the channel lineup to load. It kept freezing at 72%. The cable company said it's a TiVo issue and TiVo told me to get a new cable card. After changing my cable card numerous times, eventually you begin to wonder if it's not the cable cards and something else. It's a pretty popular subject in online reviews so it's a pretty common problem. Well...I had enough sitting on hold for the cable company and then sitting on hold for TiVo. I went crawling back to my cable company for the regular DVR and they had it working within 15 minutes. Not worth the hassle.",Amazon,-0.902,1,Very Negative,BOLT,

When they talk to you their menu systems are still from older TiVo models.what they see on their guides is different then what you see on the TiVo screen. VOD with xfinity does not work. TiVo or Comcast have no idea what the issue is. Finger pointing is at its exteme.

The new and heavily marketed Skipmode is a joke.  It only works if the channel the program is recorded from is supported by TiVo and the list of channels is quite limited.  The apps seldom work right.  They constantly crash.  Plex is a big crasher.  The new Hulu app that was announced on Dec. 15 will not download and install.

They are banking on you not noticing the charge, and when you do notice, not letting you cancel if it's not the exact date the contract ends, charging early termination fees, and sending your bill to collections. They have turned from what used to be a great, fun company into a Comcast style evil bag.The BOLT itself is horrible. It does not serve 4k signal to my 4k TV- and barely has enough storage to really hold much 4k video. The included applications (Netflix, Amazon) crash to a pink screen of death after about 3 seconds of video.  It runs as slow as the rest of the TiVos.

They offered to send me a REFURBISHED unit! My Bolt was 2 weeks old!  $300 for a used poduct that needs to be unplugged and plugged in when someone wants to watch TV? No thanks! Sent it back and will stay with DirecTV. Never had an issue with the Genie and the box was free.

I get directions to log into my TiVo account to get it, but apparently you can't set up a TiVo account (to log into) without having the media access key first. Apparently its a common problem because there are tons of blogs dedicated to this.  Some people have been talking to customer service for weeks about this.

A committee made up of a handful of TiVo employees watches the first run of these shows, it times the beginning and duration of each commercial, then it sends this low-tech information to all the Bolt boxes, maybe. ""Skip"" shows are said to be marked with a special symbol for easy identification.They are not. After about 72 hours, I have been unable even to detect a single commercial-skipping show, much less actually skip commercials. The old, annoying, hit-or-miss skip methods work, but not any better than on pre-Bolt machines.The shows selected are chosen solely on the basis of popularity. If you have more taste than a prime-time TV lover (i.e any taste in entertainment at all) you're outa luck. If not, this may be the appliance of your dreams.As a corporation, TiVo's not all bad.

I purchased a TIVO when the company was new, and also purchased lifetime service plan. The catch I learned later is, the service works with one box, no matter how out-of-date the box becomes. TIVO should allow lifetime subscribers like myself to transfer the service to a newer box. If that was the case, I would have purchased at least 2 newer units by now.  My interest was really peaked when the Bolt was released. It does everything I needed from a OTA DVR.  However, instead of buying the new TIVO box, I purchased a 4-Tuner TABLO and their lifetime service, which transfers to all new boxes. TIVO why not think about long time customers sometimes?
