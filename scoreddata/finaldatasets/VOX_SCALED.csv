Unfortunately, The VOX remote is a step backwards. My old slide pro remote was a learning remote and I was able to program it to turn ON/OFF BOTH the TV and the AV receiver. I CAN\'T DO THATt with the VOX remote.  It won\'t TURN OFF/ON two devices at the same time. Also, to skip  the Ads (which is a GREAT feature), on the old slide remote pro,  I push on the D button and it skips. You can do that on a VOX remote, but to use your voice, you have to push Voice and then speak ""Skip"", so two steps on the new VOX remote- push button and speak, while one step on the old slide remote- push D.",TechReviews,-0.1,2,Negative
