It seems default is 1 thumbs-up, even ""Channel Unavailable""! Before you know it everything is in your Suggestions Folder and your box decides to record for itself. Extremely irritating when you want your own choices and are told all three ""recorders"" are full. Why are Suggestions given priority over your own decisions? Not easy to get out of in order to record or view what you want and the only way to prevent this is to delete everything in your Suggestions and then keep on actively giving all the hundreds of channels a Thumbs-down.
