20-04-2017,"First, Bolt uses SkipMode to automatically and smartly skip commercials seamlessly, a feature that consumers have wanted pretty much before the TiVo even existed. Second, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new QuickMode feature that speeds things up by around 30%, but keeps voices smooth and low so you can listen without being irritated by the chipmunks. TiVo hints that this will be handy when catching up on DVRed sports games.",TechReviews,0.250059032,4,Positive

19-04-2017 00:54,"\r\n8) The famous Tivo ""30-second-skip"" button works well for moving past commercials. Since most commercial breaks are about three minutes, I wish there was an additional button targeted at skipping that longer length.",TechReviews,0.1875,3,Neutral

15-04-2017,"\r\n3) Tivo made some head-scratching decisions around commercial skipping. For example, on programs where skipping IS available, you have to click the SKIP button on EACH commercial break. Why not simply enable 'skipmode' for the length of the recording? Who would want to see some commercials but not others? Another example: Commercial skipping is apparently never available on sports - even when sports programs are among the top primetime programs (e.g. Sunday Night Football).",TechReviews,0.1,3,Neutral
15-04-2017,"\r\n6) The web-based viewing available at online.tivo.com has some bugs. It mostly works, but sometimes the UI becomes unresponsive (30-second skip just stops responding).

15-04-2017,"\nAs to the commercial skip feature, I suspect it's not automatic for the entire show to avoid the legal issues another DVR company faced.

15-04-2017,"he TiVo Roamio is a great device. I recently "" cut the cord"" but wanted to be able to have a tv guide and recorder. The Roamio provides exactly what I wanted with no monthly fees. The commercial skip button is the BOMB!! Love it!! Netflix and Amazon seem to load in half the time that it took my Smart TV to load them. The picture and sound quality is outstanding. I am extremely happy with the Roamio - kudos to TiVo.",TechReviews,0.370806277,4,Positive

15-04-2017,"I love my new TiVo. Commercial skip is great. No future dvr fees is also awesome. However, to have multi room viewing, multiple TiVo minis or a TiVo stream is required at $150 a pop. So it's awesome but too expensive for multiple screens",TechReviews,0.293636364,4,Positive
