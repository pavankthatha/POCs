26-04-2017,"hank you for writing to TiVo, Inc. We are always delighted to hear from our subscribers, particularly when they offer us an opportunity to address concerns and improve TiVo service. Certainly, your letter qualifies. In it, you state that your TiVo is programmed to automatically record three programs every week: 24, WWE Raw, and UFC \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c The Ultimate Fighter. Based on these regularly recorded programs, as well as one-time only recordings like UFC 76: Knockout, the Tivo Suggestions function has recommended other programming it believes you will like. According to your letter, most of these suggestions are logical, although you do not always watch them. For example, TiVo suggested that you watch WWE Friday Night Smackdown! because you like WWE Raw, although you declined, feeling that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plotlines are pedestrian and don\xe2\x80\x99t move the human spirit\xe2\x80\x9d in the same way that WWE Raw does.",TechReviews,0.076867478,3,Neutral

In those pages, you berated TiVo for thinking you could enjoy a \xe2\x80\x9cstupid kids show\xe2\x80\x9d that features \xe2\x80\x9csome annoying 14-year old Disneyfied, popstar wannabe.\xe2\x80\x9d Apparently you felt particularly betrayed upon learning that Billy Ray Cyrus also starred, writing that you \xe2\x80\x9cactually ripped out a car radio and threw it on the highway\xe2\x80\x9d when your favorite radio station played \xe2\x80\x9cAchy Breaky Heart\xe2\x80\x9d during the height of its popularity.",TechReviews,0.015833333,3,Neutral

Awhile back we were away and the disk became nearly full of recorded shows, so no Suggestions were recorded. After we watched and deleted the recorded shows, we realized that there were still no Suggestions being added. I have tried the solutions here: 1. Rebooting to set Suggestions off and then again to set them on; and 2. Resetting the Thumbs ratings and then recreating them. That has resulted in a few Suggestions being recorded, but they are limited to additional back episodes of shows to which we have Season Passes. There are no Suggestions based on movies or other one-time recordings, which is a big disappointment since we felt that previously the Suggestions which were recorded were a good cross-section of our interests as expressed in all of our recordings.
